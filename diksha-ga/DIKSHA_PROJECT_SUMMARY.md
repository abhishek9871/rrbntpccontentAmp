# Systematic Collection of General Awareness Study Materials from DIKSHA for RRB NTPC

## Executive Overview & Objectives

This report documents a systematic, audit-ready approach to discover, collect, and catalog General Awareness study materials aligned with the Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) Non-Technical Popular Categories (NTPC) syllabus, with a primary focus on resources accessible via DIKSHA—the national digital platform for school education. The objective is threefold: first, to map RRB NTPC General Awareness topics to likely content habitats on DIKSHA; second, to collect downloadable NCERT textbooks and related open educational resources (OER) that match those topics; and third, to establish a reproducible workflow—including directory structures, metadata standards, and logging protocols—that curricular designers and content operations teams can operationalize with confidence.

The scope spans Indian History (ancient, medieval, modern), Geography (physical, Indian, world), Polity (Constitution and governance), Economy (basic concepts), Current Affairs (national, international, sports, awards), Static General Knowledge (important dates, organizations, books-authors), and Science & Technology (general scientific developments and applications). Deliverables include categorized content stored in a structured repository, comprehensive metadata capturing source, licensing, language, and subject mapping, and a detailed activity log capturing all platform interactions, access pathways, and any anomalies encountered.

The DIKSHA platform is the canonical national infrastructure for school education in India, developed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) under the Ministry of Education and powered by open-source Sunbird technology. It is designed for multi-language delivery, state/UT customization, and integration with initiatives such as PM eVidya and NISHTHA. Crucially, DIKSHA hosts energized textbooks, online courses, quizzes, and question banks contributed by NCERT, CBSE, NIOS, and State/UT boards, and supports accessibility for Children With Special Needs (CWSN) via audiobooks and Indian Sign Language resources.[^1][^3][^4][^10]

Within the DIKSHA context, the General Awareness content sought for RRB NTPC primarily aligns with NCERT Social Science textbooks for Classes IX–XII—particularly History, Geography, Political Science, and Economics—as well as foundational science content that underpins scientific literacy tested in NTPC. DIKSHA’s architecture and content licensing (e.g., CC BY NC-ND for NCERT textbooks; CC BY NC-SA for other resources) enable compliant redistribution of materials with clear attribution, language tagging, and preservation of original formats.[^3]

## DIKSHA Platform Profile & Content Discovery Strategy

DIKSHA’s governance model, content contributions, and building blocks explain why it is the right starting point for RRB NTPC-aligned General Awareness resources:

- Governance and reach. DIKSHA is available nationally, adopted by states and union territories, and supports 36 Indian languages. States and UTs customize access and content presentation; contributors include NCERT, CBSE, NIOS, and State/UT boards.[^1][^3][^4]
- Building blocks. DIKSHA offers energized textbooks, online courses, content authoring and sourcing, interactive quizzes, question banks, chatbot, analytics, and dashboards—all relevant to discover and retrieve high-quality study assets.[^3]
- Accessibility and inclusion. DIKSHA provides audiobooks, Indian Sign Language videos, and resources for CWSN—important for inclusive content design and ensuring the same materials can serve diverse learner needs.[^3]
- Licensing. NCERT textbooks on DIKSHA are typically under CC BY NC-ND, and many other resources under CC BY NC-SA; this licensing enables compliant use and redistribution with appropriate attribution.[^3]

Search strategies on DIKSHA should exploit role-based exploration (Student, Teacher, Parent), content publisher filters (NCERT, CBSE, NIOS, State Boards), and focus areas (e.g., energized textbooks, quizzes). Because DIKSHA centralizes K–12 curriculum content, RRB NTPC General Awareness themes map naturally to NCERT Social Science syllabi and textbooks for Classes IX–XII, supplemented by science materials for foundational concepts.[^1][^3][^12]

To illustrate content discovery across publishers and focus areas, the matrix below summarizes common entry points:

Table 1: DIKSHA content exploration matrix

|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User Role (Student)  | Energized textbooks, practice quizzes                | Direct alignment to NCERT textbooks (History, Geo, Polity, Econ)  |
| Content Publisher    | NCERT textbooks, CBSE/NIOs resources, State content  | High-quality textbooks, bilingual editions where available        |
| Focus Initiatives    | PM eVidya linkages, NISHTHA training, Virtual Labs   | Broader pedagogical assets and science-linked learning materials  |

### Access Models and Browser Pathways

Access on DIKSHA varies by role. For students and teachers, the platform typically allows browsing and discovery without forced authentication; however, deeper interactions—such as downloading large packages or accessing state-specific consolidated libraries—may require account-based access. The implications for batch collection include:

- Session management and rate-limiting. Browser-driven discovery should plan for session continuity and polite crawling to avoid rate limits.
- Dynamic links and redirection. Energized textbooks and QR-linked assets can lead to dynamic endpoints; manual verification of static mirrors is often needed for stable downloads.
- Mirrors and fallbacks. When dynamic endpoints are blocked or slow, static textbook mirrors and vetted educational portals provide reliable alternatives (see the Mirrors & Alternative Sources section), while ensuring licensing compliance and attribution.[^1][^3]

## Mapping RRB NTPC GA Syllabus to DIKSHA Content

General Awareness for RRB NTPC comprises a broad sweep of topics that largely overlap with NCERT Social Science textbooks for Classes IX–XII. History topics align with textbooks on Indian and world history; Geography aligns with physical, human, and regional geography; Polity aligns with Indian Constitution and political system content; Economy aligns with introductory micro/macroeconomics and Indian economic development; Science & Technology aligns with general science textbooks and basic applied concepts.

### Indian History

Ancient India. For deep conceptual coverage, NCERT’s Class XII “Themes in Indian History – Part I” is appropriate, complemented by Class VI “Our Pasts – I” for foundational narratives. Medieval India. Class XII “Themes in Indian History – Part II” and Class VII “Our Pasts – II” cover polity, culture, and regional developments. Modern India. Class XII “Themes in Indian History – Part III” and Class VIII “Our Pasts – III (Part 2)” address the freedom struggle, colonial policies, and independence. World History context appears in Classes IX–XI textbooks focusing on contemporary world themes that situate Indian history within global developments.

| Modern India             | Themes in Indian History – Part III; Our Pasts – III (Part 2) | XII; VIII       |
| World History Context    | India and the Contemporary World – I & II; Themes in World History | IX–XI           |

### Geography

Physical Geography. Class XI “Fundamentals of Physical Geography” is a primary text covering earth system processes and environmental phenomena. Indian Geography. Class IX–X “Contemporary India – I & II” and Class XI “India – Physical Environment” provide regional physical and human perspectives. World Geography. Class XII “Fundamentals of Human Geography” addresses global patterns of settlement, migration, and economic activity. Complementary Class VI–VIII textbooks on environment and resources support foundational understanding.

Table 4: Geography sub-topic mapping

| Sub-Topic          | Textbook(s)                                   | Class Level |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------|
| Physical           | Fundamentals of Physical Geography            | XI         |
| India              | Contemporary India – I & II; India – Physical Environment | IX–X; XI   |
| World              | Fundamentals of Human Geography               | XII        |
| Foundational (VI–VIII) | The Earth Our Habitat; Our Environment; Resources and Development | VI–VIII    |

### Polity & Governance

Core polity topics derive from Class XI “Indian Constitution at Work” and Class IX–X “Democratic Politics – I & II,” which cover constitutional features, governance, union and state executive structures, and the judiciary. These texts establish conceptual clarity required for NTPC GA’s polity component.

Table 5: Polity concept mapping

| Concept Area        | Textbook(s)                          | Class Level |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|
| Constitution        | Indian Constitution at Work          | XI         |
| Governance & Democracy | Democratic Politics – I & II     | IX–X       |

### Economy

The GA economy component is best served by Class IX–X basics (“Economics” and “Understanding Economic Development”) and Class XII micro/macroeconomics, with Class XI “Indian Economic Development” providing context on structural changes, development issues, and policy debates.

Table 6: Economy topic mapping

| Topic                         | Textbook(s)                                            | Class Level |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Basic Economics              | Economics (Class IX); Understanding Economic Development (Class X) | IX–X       |
| Indian Economic Development  | Indian Economic Development (Class XI)                 | XI         |
| Microeconomics               | Introductory Microeconomics (Class XII – Part 1)      | XII        |
| Macroeconomics               | Introductory Macroeconomics (Class XII – Part 2)      | XII        |

### Science & Technology

NTPC’s Science & Technology coverage benefits from NCERT’s foundational science textbooks in Classes IX–X (integrated science) and the Class XI–XII Physics, Chemistry, and Biology sequences, which reinforce conceptual clarity for general scientific developments and applications.[^15]

### Current Affairs & Static GK

DIKSHA is not a news platform; therefore, Current Affairs require external compilations aligned to RRB NTPC cadence (national/international events, sports, awards). Monthly compendia and one-liners offer efficient revision instruments and can be captured with source attribution. Static GK, including organizations, books-authors, and important dates, should be curated from reputable compilations and captured with metadata and source URLs in the repository.

Table 7: Current Affairs coverage plan (illustrative)

| Period Covered        | Source Type            | Update Cadence | Proposed Storage Location        |
|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Jan–May 2025 (sample) | One-liner PDF + web listing | Monthly        | current-affairs/national/        |
| Jan–May 2025 (sample) | One-liner PDF + web listing | Monthly        | current-affairs/international/   |
| Rolling 2025          | Sports awards/events compilations | Monthly/Quarterly | current-affairs/sports/       |

Sources: HimExam’s 2025 National + International compilation and Career Power monthly PDFs provide indicative coverage.[^20][^21] National sports awards lists and sports winners’ compendia can augment sports segments.[^22][^23][^24]

### Static GK

Static GK should be structured by sub-topic and captured with consistent metadata, including source name, URL, and relevance tags.

Table 8: Static GK taxonomy and metadata fields

| Sub-Topic                | Metadata Fields                                 | Proposed Location            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Organizations            | source_name, source_url, subject_tags, language | static-gk/organizations/     |
| Books–Authors            | source_name, source_url, subject_tags, language | static-gk/books-authors/     |
| Important Dates          | source_name, source_url, subject_tags, language | static-gk/important-dates/   |

## Download Workflow & Tools

The download workflow should be designed for reproducibility, compliance, and auditability:

- Tools and commands. Use curl or wget to download PDFs/ZIPs, respecting server constraints and using retries/back-off to avoid rate limiting. For large files or dynamic endpoints, prefer manual verification of stable mirrors.
- Mirrors & fallback. When the official NCERT textbook portal is intermittently unavailable, reliable educational portals—validated for NCERT licensing and attribution—can serve as mirrors, subject to compliance checks (e.g., Vedantu’s NCERT PDF listings and BYJU’S textbook directories).[^15][^16]
- Bilingual retrieval. Capture both English and Hindi editions where available, using standardized naming conventions with language tags.
- Formats & integrity. Preserve original formats (PDF/ZIP). Record file sizes and SHA-256 hashes for integrity checks.
- Security & hygiene. Validate checksums post-download and maintain a human-readable and machine-parsable log.

| rrb_ntpc_tags          | Topic tags aligned to GA syllabus                   |

### Integrity Checks & Metadata Population

After download, compute SHA-256 hashes and compare against pre-recorded values to ensure completeness and integrity. Populate metadata for each asset—subject, class, title, language, source, license, tags—and link to GA coverage. Maintain two logs:

- Machine-parsable: JSON/CSV with schema fields for automation.
- Human-readable: An annotated activity log documenting commands used, retries, anomalies, and final verification steps.

## Directory Structure & Categorization (diksha-ga/)

The repository should mirror GA themes and DIKSHA/NCERT organization logic while keeping storage stable and navigable.

Table 10: Folder layout blueprint

| Folder                         | Contents                                                           |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| diksha-ga/geography/           | Physical (XI), India (IX–XI), World (XII), Foundational (VI–VIII)  |
| diksha-ga/polity/              | Democratic Politics (IX–X), Indian Constitution at Work (XI)       |
| diksha-ga/economy/             | Class IX–X basics, XI Indian Economic Development, XII Micro/Macro |
| diksha-ga/indian-history/      | Ancient/Medieval/Modern volumes (VI–VII; VIII; XII Parts I–III)    |
| diksha-ga/science-technology/  | Class IX–X science, Class XI–XII Physics/Chemistry/Biology         |
| diksha-ga/current-affairs/     | National, International, Sports (monthly/quarterly updates)        |
| diksha-ga/static-gk/           | Organizations, Books–Authors, Important Dates                      |
| diksha-ga/metadata/            | JSON/CSV catalogs; schema definitions                              |

Naming conventions should encode subject, class, language, and canonical title for unambiguous retrieval.

Table 11: File naming convention examples

| Subject   | Class | Language | Title Variant Example                          | Example Filename                                 |

| Polity    | XI    | HI       | Indian Constitution at Work (Hindi edition)   | pol_XI_HI_indian_constitution_at_work.pdf        |
| Economy   | X     | EN       | Understanding Economic Development            | eco_X_EN_understanding_economic_development.pdf  |
| History   | XII   | EN       | Themes in Indian History – Part I             | his_XII_EN_themes_indian_history_part1.pdf       |

## Mirrors & Alternative Sources

Because dynamic endpoints on the official NCERT textbook portal may be intermittently inaccessible, mirrors can ensure continuity of downloads while maintaining licensing compliance and attribution. Vedantu and BYJU’S maintain public-facing directories of NCERT textbooks in English and Hindi; these links often resolve to stable ZIP/PDF artifacts.[^15][^16] When using mirrors:

- Verify licensing statements (e.g., NCERT CC BY NC-ND).
- Record mirror source URLs in metadata and the log.
- Prefer official NCERT sources where accessible; use mirrors as fallbacks.

Table 12: Source reliability checklist

| Criterion            | What to Check                                           |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Authority            | NCERT/CBSE/NIOS/state boards; reputable educational portals |
| Licensing            | CC BY NC-ND (NCERT textbooks); CC BY NC-SA (others)     |
| Stability            | Availability history; mirror responsiveness             |
| Completeness         | Full textbook chapters included                         |
| Language Coverage    | English/Hindi where available                           |

## Documentation & Logging Standards

A standardized activity log should record every significant action—searches, navigation, access attempts, downloads, retries, and verifications—alongside timestamps and outcomes. This log is the audit backbone for both compliance and troubleshooting.

Table 14: Activity log schema

| Field        | Description                                        |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| timestamp    | Date/time of action                                |
| action       | e.g., search, navigate, download, verify, retry    |
| url          | Target URL                                         |
| outcome      | success/failure/redirect/partial                   |
| notes        | Context (errors, retries, validation checks)       |
| operator     | Person/system initiating action                    |

The log should be maintained in parallel with metadata catalogs. Sample log entries are included in Appendices.

## Licensing & Compliance

DIKSHA’s licensing framework is explicit and supportive of compliant redistribution:

- NCERT textbooks: CC BY NC-ND ( Attribution–NonCommercial–NoDerivatives).
- Other resources: CC BY NC-SA ( Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike).

The repository must preserve original licensing notices and include proper attribution statements for each asset. Where content originates from DIKSHA/NCERT, attribution should identify the contributor (e.g., NCERT, CBSE, NIOS, State Board), textbook title, class, and license.[^3] If any content’s license is unclear, use it for internal study only and avoid redistribution; clearly flag such items in metadata.

## Quality Assurance & Validation

Quality assurance should be both automated and editorial:

- Completeness. Verify that all targeted GA topics have corresponding assets or placeholders in the catalog.
- Integrity. Use checksum validation (SHA-256) and size checks to confirm successful downloads.
- Alignment. Cross-check assets against GA taxonomy (History, Geography, Polity, Economy, Science & Tech, Current Affairs, Static GK).
- Editorial spot checks. Sample chapters for readability, language fidelity, and content completeness—especially for bilingual pairs.

Table 15: QA checklist

| Checkpoint            | Method                                         | Pass Criteria                               |

| Alignment             | Tag-based validation against NTPC GA mapping  | All items carry correct subject/class/topic tags |
| Readability           | Editorial spot checks                          | No corruption; readable; bilingual pairing verified |
| License Compliance    | Attribution and license field checks          | License recorded; attribution preserved      |

## Progress, Gaps & Next Steps

Progress summary. The discovery and mapping phases are complete: DIKSHA’s role as the national K–12 platform is confirmed; NCERT textbooks for Classes IX–XII have been mapped to GA themes (History, Geography, Polity, Economy, Science). Current Affairs and Static GK requirements have been scoped with appropriate external sources. Download pathways and fallback mirrors are established, and metadata/logging schemas are defined. The directory structure is specified and ready for population.

Gaps. Several activities remain outstanding pending platform access windows or resource stability:

- Interactive content review. DIKSHA’s quizzes and question banks are not yet audited for downloadability; assessment of their export formats is pending.
- Dynamic link verification. Some DIKSHA endpoints may require manual browsing; mapping to stable static links may be needed.
- Current Affairs ingestion. Systematic ingestion of monthly PDFs for 2025 has been scoped but not fully executed; an update cadence and automation plan still needs approval.
- Hindi pairings. Comprehensive pairing for all English textbooks with Hindi editions is not yet finalized.
- License notes insertion. Adding license snippets and attribution tags in file metadata is pending.

Information gaps and assumptions:

- DIKSHA does not maintain explicit Current Affairs or Static GK repositories; these are sourced externally with careful attribution and periodic updates.
- Some DIKSHA endpoints may require manual browsing for stable static links; mirrors are used where necessary, with license checks.
- Official NCERT textbook links can be intermittently inaccessible; fallback mirrors are used while retaining compliance and attribution.
- Hindi pairing is available for many textbooks but may require additional verification during ingestion.
- DIKSHA’s question banks/quizzes have not yet been audited for direct downloadability; this is a planned activity.
- Comprehensive pairing of all English textbooks with Hindi editions remains a gap pending final checks and metadata enrichment.

# RRB Digital Examination Portal Authentication Research Plan

## Task Overview
Investigate RRB's digital examination portal (rrb.digialm.com) and other authentication-protected resources to document access procedures, identify publicly available sample papers or demo content, and analyze authentication requirements.

## Research Objectives
1. **Portal Access Investigation**: Test direct access to rrb.digialm.com and similar authentication-protected resources
2. **Authentication Requirements Analysis**: Document what credentials are needed and the authentication process
3. **Public Content Discovery**: Identify any publicly available sample papers, demo content, or unscrutinized resources
4. **Access Method Documentation**: Document different ways to access protected content
5. **Alternative Access Pathways**: Research any backup or alternative access methods

        <p><strong>Chemistry</strong> is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter. It examines the chemical elements, compounds, atoms, molecules, and ions, including their composition, structure, properties, behavior, and the changes they undergo during reactions.</p>

        <h2>Atomic Structure</h2>
        <p>The atom is the basic unit of chemistry. It consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus and a surrounding space occupied by an electron cloud.</p>

        <h3>Nucleus Composition</h3>
        <p>The nucleus is composed of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons (together called nucleons). The electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the number of negatively charged electrons equals the number of positively charged protons. The mass of a nucleon is approximately 1,836 times that of an electron. The atom is the smallest entity that retains the chemical properties of an element.</p>

        <h2>Periodic Classification (Elements)</h2>

        <h3>Chemical Elements</h3>
        <p>A chemical element is a pure substance made of a single type of atom. Elements are characterized by their atomic number (Z), which is the unique number of protons in the nuclei of its atoms. The mass number is the sum of protons and neutrons in a nucleus.</p>

        <h3>Isotopes</h3>
        <p>Isotopes are atoms of the same element that have the same atomic number but different mass numbers (due to different numbers of neutrons). For example, Carbon atoms always have 6 protons but can have mass numbers of 12 or 13.</p>

        <h3>The Periodic Table</h3>
        <p>The standard presentation of chemical elements is the periodic table, which orders elements by atomic number. The periodic table is arranged in vertical columns called groups and horizontal rows called periods. It is useful for identifying periodic trends in chemical properties.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Bonding</h2>
        <p>Chemical bonds hold atoms together in molecules or crystals. Common types of chemical bonds include covalent bonds, ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, and Van der Waals forces.</p>

        <h3>Ionic Bond</h3>
        <p>Formed when a metal atom loses one or more electrons to become a positively charged ion (cation), and a non-metal atom gains these electrons to become a negatively charged ion (anion). The electrostatic attraction between these oppositely charged ions forms the bond. Example: Sodium (Na) losing an electron to Chlorine (Cl) forms sodium chloride (NaCl).</p>

        <h3>Covalent Bond</h3>
        <p>Formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of valence electrons. The resulting group of bonded atoms is called a molecule, which is typically electrically neutral.</p>

        <h3>Octet Rule</h3>
        <p>Atoms often share valence electrons to achieve a stable noble gas electron configuration (usually eight electrons in their outermost shell), known as the octet rule. Elements like hydrogen and lithium follow the duet rule, aiming for two electrons in their outermost shell (like helium). Example: In a methane (CH4) molecule, the carbon atom shares electrons with four hydrogen atoms, satisfying the octet rule for carbon and the duet rule for hydrogen.</p>

        <h2>Chemical Reactions</h2>
        <p>A chemical reaction is a process that results in the transformation of one or more substances into different substances. The basis of a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms.</p>

        <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
        <p>Chemical reactions can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation. In non-nuclear chemical reactions, the number and type of atoms remain conserved on both sides of the chemical equation (Law of Conservation of Mass).</p>

        <h3>Types of Chemical Reactions</h3>
        <p>Chemical reactions usually involve the making or breaking of chemical bonds. Examples of common chemical reactions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oxidation:</strong> Loss of electrons</li>
            <li><strong>Reduction (Redox reactions):</strong> Gain of electrons</li>
            <li><strong>Dissociation:</strong> Breaking apart of molecules or compounds</li>
            <li><strong>Acid-base neutralization:</strong> Reaction between acids and bases</li>
            <li><strong>Molecular rearrangement:</strong> Atoms reorganizing within molecules</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Energy in Chemical Reactions</h3>
        <p>Chemical reactions are accompanied by energy changes (e.g., exothermic reactions release heat, endothermic reactions absorb heat). An activation energy is required for a chemical reaction to occur. A system at chemical equilibrium is one where the chemical composition remains unchanged over time, but the molecules continue to react (dynamic equilibrium).</p>

    <h1>Environmental Issues</h1>
    
    <p>The web content from Wikipedia provides a comprehensive overview of environmental issues, suitable for competitive exam preparation. Environmental issues are defined as disruptions in the function of ecosystems, caused by human impact or natural events, which are considered serious when the ecosystem cannot recover.</p>

    <h2>Types of Environmental Issues</h2>
    <p>Major current environmental issues include climate change, pollution, environmental degradation, and resource depletion. The UN has framed these as the 'triple planetary crises': climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss. The conservation movement focuses on protecting endangered species, ecologically valuable areas, and addresses issues like genetically modified foods and global warming.</p>

    <h2>Human Impact on the Environment</h2>
    <p>Human (anthropogenic) impact refers to changes to biophysical environments, ecosystems, biodiversity, and natural resources. Key drivers include population growth (approx. 80 million people per year), overconsumption (especially by wealthy populations), overexploitation, pollution, and deforestation. These activities lead to severe effects such as global warming, environmental degradation (e.g., ocean acidification), mass extinction (the sixth mass extinction), biodiversity loss, and ecological crises.</p>

    <h2>Pollution</h2>
    <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful contaminants into the natural environment. It's often classed as point source (from a specific site like a factory) or nonpoint source (from widespread sources like agricultural runoff).</p>

    <h3>Major Forms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Air pollution</li>
        <li>Water pollution</li>
        <li>Litter</li>
        <li>Noise pollution</li>
        <li>Plastic pollution</li>
        <li>Soil contamination</li>
        <li>Radioactive contamination</li>
        <li>Thermal pollution</li>
        <li>Light pollution</li>
        <li>Visual pollution</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Impact on Human Health</h3>
    <p>Pollution was responsible for approximately 9 million deaths worldwide in 2019 (one in six deaths), with about three-quarters caused by air pollution.</p>

    <h3>Impact on Ecosystems</h3>
    <p>A 2022 review found anthropogenic chemical pollution has exceeded planetary boundaries, threatening entire ecosystems.</p>

    <h2>Environmental Degradation and Resource Depletion</h2>
    <p>Environmental degradation is the deterioration of the environment through resource depletion (air, water, soil), destruction of ecosystems, habitat destruction, wildlife extinction, and pollution. The UN defines it as 'the reduction of the capacity of the environment to meet social and ecological objectives, and needs'. Resource depletion is a key aspect of degradation, caused by overexploitation of natural resources.</p>

    <h2>Climate Change</h2>
    <p>Identified as a major environmental issue and part of the 'triple planetary crises'. It is a primary consequence of human impact, mainly driven by the burning of fossil fuels. The 2023 IPCC report highlights its disproportionate effects on vulnerable populations and the amplification of risks to human health and ecosystems through extreme weather events.</p>

    <h2>Deforestation</h2>
    <p>Cited as a direct cause of human impact and a visible form of environmental degradation. It contributes to climate change and biodiversity loss.</p>

    <h2>Impacts on Ecosystems and Human Health</h2>

    <h3>Ecosystems</h3>
    <p>Impacts include habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, the sixth mass extinction, ocean acidification, and the overall collapse of ecosystem functions.</p>

    <h3>Human Health</h3>
    <p>Direct impacts include millions of deaths from pollution. Indirectly, climate change amplifies risks to human health through extreme weather, and environmental degradation affects resources essential for life.</p>

    <h2>Statistics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pollution Impact:</strong> In 2019, pollution killed approximately 9 million people worldwide, which is about one in six deaths. About three-quarters of these deaths were caused by air pollution.</li>
        <li><strong>Population Growth:</strong> World population is still increasing by roughly 80 million people per year, or more than 200,000 per day.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Conflicts:</strong> The Environmental Justice Atlas documented 3,100 environmental conflicts worldwide as of April 2020.</li>
    </ul>

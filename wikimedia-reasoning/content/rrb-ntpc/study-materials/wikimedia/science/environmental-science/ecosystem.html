    <h1>Ecosystem</h1>
    
    <p>An ecosystem is a community of living organisms (biotic components) interacting with the nonliving components of their environment (abiotic components). These components are linked through energy flows and nutrient cycles.</p>

    <h2>Ecosystem Components</h2>
    <p>Ecosystems consist of biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components. Biotic components include producers (plants), consumers (animals), and decomposers (fungi, bacteria). Abiotic components include the physical environment like climate, soil, water, and topography. These components are interconnected through energy flow and nutrient cycling.</p>

    <h3>Biotic Components</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Producers (Plants):</strong> Living organisms that produce their own food through photosynthesis</li>
        <li><strong>Consumers (Animals):</strong> Living organisms that consume other organisms for energy</li>
        <li><strong>Decomposers (Microbes):</strong> Microorganisms that break down dead organic matter</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Abiotic Components</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Physical and chemical components of the environment</li>
        <li>Climate factors</li>
        <li>Soil composition</li>
        <li>Water availability</li>
        <li>Topography and landscape features</li>
        <li>Parent material (geological foundations)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Energy Flow, Food Chains, and Food Webs</h2>

    <h3>Energy Flow</h3>
    <p>Energy enters ecosystems primarily through photosynthesis (primary production), where plants convert light energy into organic matter. This energy is transferred through the ecosystem via consumption. Energy is incorporated into living tissue, transferred to other organisms, and eventually released through respiration.</p>

    <h3>Food Chains</h3>
    <p>A food chain is a linear sequence of consumption: plant → herbivore → carnivore. In terrestrial ecosystems, most net primary production enters the detritus-based trophic system through decomposition.</p>

    <h3>Food Webs</h3>
    <p>A food web is a more complex and realistic representation, consisting of interconnected food chains where organisms may feed at multiple trophic levels.</p>

    <h2>Biogeochemical Cycles</h2>
    <p>This refers to the cycling of mineral nutrients between organisms and the environment.</p>

    <h3>Nitrogen Cycle</h3>
    <p>Most nitrogen enters ecosystems via biological nitrogen fixation by bacteria. The cycle involves:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mineralization:</strong> Organic nitrogen converts to ammonium</li>
        <li><strong>Nitrification:</strong> Ammonium converts to nitrate</li>
        <li><strong>Denitrification:</strong> Nitrate converts to nitrogen gas</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Mycorrhizal fungi play a key role in transferring nitrogen to plants.</p>

    <h3>Phosphorus Cycle</h3>
    <p>Enters ecosystems primarily through the weathering of rocks. Phosphorus availability can become a limiting factor in older landscapes.</p>

    <h3>Other Nutrient Cycles</h3>
    <p>Other nutrients like carbon, calcium, and sulfur also have their own cycles.</p>

    <h2>Nutrient Types</h2>

    <h3>Macronutrients</h3>
    <h4>Primary (Most Often Limiting)</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Nitrogen (N)</li>
        <li>Phosphorus (P)</li>
        <li>Potassium (K)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Secondary</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Calcium (Ca)</li>
        <li>Magnesium (Mg)</li>
        <li>Sulfur (S)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Micronutrients</h3>
    <p>Boron, chloride, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, zinc</p>

    <h3>Beneficial Nutrients</h3>
    <p>Aluminum, cobalt, iodine, nickel, selenium, silicon, sodium, vanadium (required by certain plants or under specific conditions)</p>

    <h2>Decomposition</h2>
    <p>Decomposition breaks down dead organic matter and returns nutrients to the ecosystem.</p>

    <h3>Decomposition Processes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Leaching:</strong> Water dissolves and carries away water-soluble components from dead organic matter</li>
        <li><strong>Fragmentation:</strong> Organic material is broken into smaller pieces by animals, freeze-thaw cycles, or wetting and drying, exposing new surfaces for microbial colonization</li>
        <li><strong>Chemical alteration:</strong> Primarily achieved through bacterial and fungal action, which produce enzymes to break down complex structures like lignin and cell walls</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Governing Factors</h3>
    <p>The physical environment (temperature, moisture, soil properties), the quantity and quality of the dead material, and the nature of the microbial community.</p>

    <h2>Controlling Factors</h2>

    <h3>External Factors</h3>
    <p>Control the ecosystem's overall structure but are not influenced by it. Examples include climate, parent material (geology), topography, time, and the potential biota of a region.</p>

    <h3>Internal Factors</h3>
    <p>Control and are controlled by ecosystem processes. Examples include decomposition, root competition, shading, disturbance, and the types of species present.</p>

    <h2>Ecological Succession</h2>
    <p>Ecosystems are dynamic and respond to disturbances through a process of directional change called succession.</p>

    <h3>Disturbance</h3>
    <p>A relatively discrete event in time that removes biomass, such as fires, floods, or volcanic eruptions.</p>

    <h3>Primary Succession</h3>
    <p>Occurs on surfaces where no soil or organic matter exists, such as after a glacial retreat or volcanic eruption.</p>

    <h3>Secondary Succession</h3>
    <p>Occurs in an area that previously supported life but has undergone a less severe disturbance (e.g., forest fire, hurricane), where soil remains. Recovery is typically faster than primary succession.</p>

    <h2>Ecosystem Services</h2>
    <p>The benefits people obtain from ecosystems.</p>

    <h3>Provisioning Services (Goods)</h3>
    <p>Tangible products like food, water, fuel, and medicinal plants.</p>

    <h3>Regulating Services</h3>
    <p>Benefits from the regulation of ecosystem processes, such as climate regulation, water purification, and pollination.</p>

    <h3>Cultural Services</h3>
    <p>Non-material benefits like aesthetic beauty, inspiration, and recreational opportunities.</p>

    <h3>Supporting Services</h3>
    <p>Services necessary for the production of all other ecosystem services, such as nutrient cycling and primary production.</p>

    <h2>Key Statistics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Anthropogenic Nitrogen Flux:</strong> Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs (from fertilizer, fossil fuel combustion, etc.) account for about 80% of all nitrogen fluxes in ecosystems.</li>
        <li><strong>Term Origin:</strong> The term 'ecosystem' was first used in 1935 in a publication by British ecologist Arthur Tansley.</li>
    </ul>

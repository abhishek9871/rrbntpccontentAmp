    <h1>Physics</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
        <p><strong>Physics</strong> is the scientific study of matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of <a href="energy.html">energy</a> and <a href="force.html">force</a>. It is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines.</p>

        <h2>Motion</h2>

        <h3>Classical Mechanics</h3>
        <p>Classical mechanics is concerned with bodies acted on by forces and bodies in motion. It may be divided into statics (study of forces on a body or bodies not subject to an acceleration), kinematics (study of motion without regard to its causes), and dynamics (study of motion and the forces that affect it). Mechanics also includes solid mechanics and fluid mechanics (known together as continuum mechanics), the latter including hydrostatics, hydrodynamics, and pneumatics. Classical mechanics works for larger and slower objects.</p>

        <h3>Aristotelian Views on Motion</h3>
        <p>Aristotle explained ideas such as motion (and gravity) with the theory of four elements. He believed that each of the four classical elements (air, fire, water, earth) had its own natural place, causing them to revert to specific places due to differing densities. His laws of motion included that heavier objects fall faster, with speed proportional to weight and inversely proportional to the density of the object it is falling through. For violent motion (motion of an object when a force is applied to it), the speed is proportional to the measure of force applied. The philosophical notion of a 'prime mover' was considered the ultimate source of all motion.</p>

        <h3>Scientific Revolution Advances</h3>
        <p>Johannes Kepler determined the laws governing the motion of planetary bodies. Isaac Newton discovered and unified the laws of motion and universal gravitation, applying calculus to solve related physical problems. Galileo Galilei related mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics, contributing to the understanding of motion.</p>

        <h3>Modern Physics Context</h3>
        <p>Relativistic mechanics, including special and general relativity, deals with motion in different frames of reference, especially at speeds approaching the speed of light or in the presence of gravitational fields. 'Action' and 'Symmetry' are fundamental concepts related to motion.</p>

        <h3>Unsolved Problems</h3>
        <p>Many everyday phenomena involving complexity, chaos, or turbulence, such as the formation of sandpiles, nodes in trickling water, the shape of water droplets, and mechanisms of surface tension catastrophes, are still poorly understood, despite relying on dynamics and mechanics.</p>

        <h2>Energy</h2>

        <h3>Definition and Thermodynamics</h3>
        <p>Energy is one of the fundamental entities studied in physics. Heat is defined as a form of energy, specifically the internal energy possessed by the particles of which a substance is composed. Thermodynamics deals with the relationships between heat and other forms of energy. Advances in thermodynamics were crucial to the development of industrialization. Statistical mechanics is a related field.</p>

        <h3>Modern Physics Context</h3>
        <p>Much of modern physics is concerned with the behavior of matter and energy under extreme conditions or on very large or very small scales. Particle physics, also known as high-energy physics, involves extremely high energies necessary to produce many types of particles in particle accelerators. Quantum theory concerns discrete energy levels, such as those of electron orbitals. Current research actively investigates dark energy, a major mystery in physics, and the mass of neutrinos (which implies energy).</p>

        <h2>Force</h2>

        <h3>Definition and Classical Understanding</h3>
        <p>Force is a fundamental entity studied in physics, acting on bodies to affect their motion. Classical mechanics is largely concerned with bodies acted on by forces. Aristotle's view on violent motion directly linked the speed of an object to the applied force. Isaac Newton's laws of motion describe the relationship between force and the motion of objects, and his law of universal gravitation describes the gravitational force.</p>

        <h3>Fundamental Interactions</h3>
        <p>The fundamental interactions (or forces) of nature are key concepts in physics, including gravitational, electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions. The unification of these forces is an ongoing aim in physics; for example, electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force are considered two aspects of the electroweak interaction. Particle physics studies the interactions between elementary constituents of matter and energy, which are mediated by gauge bosons (e.g., gluons for the strong force, W and Z bosons for the weak force, and photons for the electromagnetic force).</p>

        <h3>Condensed Matter Context</h3>
        <p>The bonding between atoms in solids and liquids, forming condensed phases of matter, is primarily due to the electromagnetic force.</p>

        <h2>Waves</h2>

        <h3>Acoustics (Sound Waves)</h3>
        <p>Acoustics is the study of how sound (a form of wave) is produced, controlled, transmitted, and received. Important modern branches include ultrasonics (study of very high frequency sound waves beyond human hearing), bioacoustics (physics of animal calls and hearing), and electroacoustics (manipulation of audible sound waves using electronics).</p>

        <h3>Optics (Light Waves)</h3>
        <p>Optics is the study of light, which is a form of electromagnetic wave. It encompasses visible light as well as infrared and ultraviolet radiation, all of which exhibit wave phenomena such as reflection, refraction, interference, diffraction, dispersion, and polarization of light. Islamic scholars, particularly Ibn al-Haytham, made significant contributions to optics, introducing the idea of light rays and verifying laws of refraction and reflection. Optical physics focuses on the fundamental properties of optical fields and their interactions with matter at a microscopic level. 'Photon' and 'Electromagnetic radiation' are key concepts.</p>

        <h3>Quantum Nature of Waves</h3>
        <p>Quantum theory is concerned with the complementary aspects of particles and waves in the description of phenomena at the atomic and subatomic level. 'Wave' is listed as a fundamental concept in modern physics.</p>

        <h2>Electricity and Magnetism</h2>

        <h3>Historical Context</h3>
        <p>Ancient Chinese observed that certain rocks (lodestone and magnetite) were attracted to one another by an invisible force, later called magnetism. Ancient Greeks discovered that objects like amber, when rubbed with fur, caused a similar invisible attraction, which was later called electricity. Both phenomena were rigorously studied starting in the 17th century.</p>

        <h3>Electromagnetism Unification</h3>
        <p>Electricity and magnetism have been studied as a single branch of physics since the early 19th century, when their intimate connection was discovered. An electric current gives rise to a magnetic field, and a changing magnetic field induces an electric current. Early classical electromagnetism posited a luminiferous aether for wave propagation, which could not be detected. The unification of electricity and magnetism into electromagnetism demonstrated these two forces were different aspects of one fundamental force. This unification process continues with the electroweak interaction.</p>

        <h3>Key Concepts and Branches</h3>
        <p>Electrostatics deals with electric charges at rest, electrodynamics with moving charges, and magnetostatics with magnetic poles at rest. Concepts like electric current, magnetic field, electric charge, electrical conduction, and superconductivity (a phenomenon involving electric current and magnetic fields) are central. The Meissner effect, where a magnet levitates above a superconductor, vividly demonstrates these principles. Lightning is a natural example of an electric current. Research in spintronics also relates to magnetism and electricity.</p>

        <h2>Branches and Fields Overview</h2>

        <h3>Major Branches</h3>
        <p>Physics is broadly divided into branches such as classical mechanics, thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, electromagnetism, photonics, relativity, quantum mechanics, atomic physics, molecular physics, optics, acoustics, condensed matter physics, high-energy particle physics, nuclear physics, chaos theory, and cosmology.</p>

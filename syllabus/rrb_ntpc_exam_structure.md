# RRB NTPC CBT 1 & CBT 2: Official Exam Structure, Syllabus Mapping, and Year-wise Pattern (2020–2025)

## Executive Summary

The Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) Non-Technical Popular Categories (NTPC) examination is conducted in a structured, multi-stage format designed to reliably screen and select candidates across graduate and undergraduate-level posts in the Indian Railways. The process involves two Computer-Based Tests (CBT 1 and CBT 2), followed by a role-specific skill test—either a Computer-Based Aptitude Test (CBAT) for Station Master and Traffic Assistant or a Typing Skill Test (TST) for clerical posts—and culminates in Document Verification and Medical examination where applicable. Across CBT 1 and CBT 2, the assessment consistently spans three core sections: Mathematics, General Intelligence & Reasoning, and General Awareness. General Science is assessed within General Awareness and is not a separate scored section in either CBT.[^2][^4]

Headline pattern parameters remain stable across recent cycles. CBT 1 comprises 100 questions for 100 marks to be solved in 90 minutes (120 minutes for PwBD candidates with a scribe). CBT 2 comprises 120 questions for 120 marks in 90 minutes (120 minutes for PwBD). Both CBTs apply a negative marking of 1/3 for each incorrect response. Minimum qualifying percentages are UR/EWS 40%, OBC/SC 30%, and ST 25%.[^2][^3][^4]

This report synthesizes the official NTPC syllabus and exam structure from verifiable documents, corroborated by credible educational portals. It clarifies that General Science appears within General Awareness and supplies comprehensive topic mappings to the Mathematics, General Intelligence & Reasoning, General Awareness, and General Science taxonomies for CBT 1 and CBT 2. It also contextualizes normalization, shortlisting ratios, and post-specific skill tests, while documenting consistency in the core exam architecture from 2020 to 2025, and annotates sources and information gaps.

## Scope, Definitions, and Methodology

This report covers RRB NTPC CBT 1 and CBT 2 structure, marking scheme, syllabus, and skill-test interface for cycles spanning 2020 through 2025. It uses two categories of sources: (a) official documents that prescribe exam structure and syllabus; and (b) credible educational portals that consolidate and annotate patterns, including post-specific processes. Official notices published by RRBs via the Ministry of Railways portal provide authoritative context and updates.[^1] For syllabus prescriptions and indicative patterns, a BYJU’s-hosted document aligned with CEN 01/2019 offers clear section lists and tables.[^2] Where official PDFs are not explicitly accessible, cross-validation uses Shiksha, Testbook, Jagran Josh, Physics Wallah (PW), and Careers360.[^3][^4][^5][^6][^9]

Topic mapping methodology: we normalize source topic lists into four canonical sections—Mathematics, General Intelligence & Reasoning, General Awareness, and General Science—and assign sub-topic taxonomies for consistent mapping. Where sources present General Science as a standalone header, we map it explicitly within General Awareness, in line with official syllabi which list “General Science and Life Science (up to 10th CBSE)” under General Awareness. The mapping distinguishes CBT 1 vs CBT 2 topic coverage, noting difficulty variations without implying syllabus divergence beyond what sources substantiate.[^2][^5]

Validation approach: (1) anchor section structures and negative marking to official and widely corroborated portals; (2) reconcile topic lists across official and portal sources; (3) flag any discrepancies explicitly; and (4) avoid over-claiming where sources are ambiguous or blocked.

## Official Exam Architecture & Selection Process (What)

The RRB NTPC selection process comprises the following sequence: CBT 1, CBT 2, CBAT (for specific posts), Typing Skill Test (for clerical posts), Document Verification, and Medical examination. Two CBTs form the core merit component for most posts; CBAT and TST are qualifying. Normalization is applied to account for multi-shift conduct. For CBT 2, shortlisting is typically at a ratio of 20 times the community-wise vacancies based on normalized CBT 1 merit.[^2][^3][^4]

Post-level differentiation: Station Master and Traffic Assistant require a CBAT with qualifying T-score thresholds, while clerical roles (e.g., Senior Clerk cum Typist, Junior Accounts Assistant cum Typist, Senior Time Keeper, Junior Clerk cum Typist, Accounts Clerk cum Typist, Junior Time Keeper) require a TST. Document Verification follows skill tests, with medical fitness checks as applicable.[^3][^4][^9]

Table 1 summarizes the end-to-end process.

### Normalization, Shortlisting & Merit Composition

Normalization adjusts for multi-shift difficulty variations and ensures fairness. For CBT 2, candidates are typically shortlisted in a ratio of 20 times the vacancies based on normalized CBT 1 merit and eligible options. Final merit composition depends on post category: CBAT posts weight 70% CBT 2 + 30% CBAT; non-CBAT posts rely on CBT 2 merit.[^2][^3][^4]

## Exam Pattern & Marking Scheme (How)

The core exam parameters are stable and consistent across portals and official syllabi. CBT 1 has 100 questions worth 100 marks in 90 minutes, and CBT 2 has 120 questions worth 120 marks in 90 minutes; for both, PwBD candidates with a scribe receive 120 minutes. Negative marking applies at 1/3 mark per wrong answer. Minimum qualifying percentages are UR/EWS 40%, OBC/SC 30%, and ST 25%.[^2][^3][^4]

Table 2 consolidates the section-wise pattern for CBT 1 and CBT 2.

Sources: official syllabus tables and widely corroborated portal data.[^2][^3][^4]

### Section Distribution Details

- CBT 1: General Awareness (40), Mathematics (30), General Intelligence & Reasoning (30). Total 100 questions and marks; duration 90 minutes (120 minutes for PwBD).[^\*][^2][^3][^4]
- CBT 2: General Awareness (50), Mathematics (35), General Intelligence & Reasoning (35). Total 120 questions and marks; duration 90 minutes (120 minutes for PwBD).[^\*][^2][^3][^4]

Note: Some portals indicate that CBT 2 is graded by 7th CPC level, meaning the same candidate may need to take separate CBT 2 papers if eligible for multiple levels.[^4][^7] Section distribution remains as above.

[^*]: Equivalent information appears across multiple credible portals; official documents confirm negative marking, durations, and shortlisting practices.

## Syllabus Framework & Topic Taxonomy (What)

RRB prescribes consistent subject coverage for CBT 1 and CBT 2 across three sections. Official syllabi list Mathematics topics, a comprehensive set of Reasoning abilities, and a broad General Awareness curriculum that includes “General Science and Life Science (up to 10th CBSE).” The sub-sections under General Awareness—such as History, Geography, Polity, Economy, Current Affairs, and Computers—are explicitly enumerated in official and portal syllabi.[^2][^5][^6]

Table 3 summarizes the top-level taxonomy per source, and Table 4 provides the consolidated topic lists by section and stage.

### Mathematics

The Mathematics syllabus spans foundational arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and elementary statistics. CBT 2 maintains the same conceptual coverage while emphasizing applied problem types (average, relative speeds, boats/trains, weight/height). Table 5 presents the mapping by stage.

### General Science (treated within GA per official syllabus)

General Science is explicitly listed as “General Science and Life Science (up to 10th CBSE)” and appears under General Awareness in official syllabi. Some portals present it separately for visibility, but it is not a standalone scored section in CBT 1 or CBT 2.[^2][^5]

Table 8: General Science Sub-domains and Examples (Mapped under GA)

| Sub-domain | Example Topics                                                                                         |

## Year-wise Exam Pattern Consistency (2020–2025)

From CEN 01/2019 through recent cycles, the section structure and negative marking scheme have remained consistent: CBT 1 (100 questions; 90 minutes) and CBT 2 (120 questions; 90 minutes), with 1/3 negative marking per wrong answer and PwBD duration extensions. Official documents also specify normalization and the indicative nature of section-wise distributions.[^2] Portal corroboration for 2025 confirms the same parameters and shortlisting practices.[^3][^4][^9]

## Post-specific Tests: CBAT and Typing Skill Test (How)

CBAT is applicable to Station Master and Traffic Assistant. It is qualifying and has no negative marking. Candidates must achieve a minimum T-score of 42 in each test battery. Final merit combines 70% of CBT 2 marks and 30% of CBAT marks for these posts. Typing Skill Test is required for clerical/typist posts; English typing requires 30 WPM, and Hindi requires 25 WPM. The test includes a 1-minute warm-up, 30-second break, and a 10-minute evaluation window. No editing tools or spell check are allowed.[^3][^4][^8][^9]

Table 10: CBAT Test Batteries and Qualifying Criteria

| Battery                 | Description (indicative)                               | Qualifying Criterion           |

## Mapping Methodology for syllabus_map.csv (How)

The mapping logic assigns normalized topics to four canonical sections and captures applicability across CBT 1 and CBT 2. Section taxonomy is fixed as Mathematics, General Intelligence & Reasoning, General Awareness, and General Science, with the caveat that General Science appears within General Awareness per official syllabi.[^2] Consistency checks reconcile official lists with portal enumerations, ensuring no topic is double-counted across sections and that applied CBT 2 emphases are captured.

Table 12: CSV Schema and Examples

| Field        | Allowed Values / Format                                     | Example Entry                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|

| section      | One of: Mathematics, General Intelligence & Reasoning, General Awareness, General Science | “Mathematics”                                       |
| cbt1         | “Yes” / “No”                                                 | “Yes”                                              |
| cbt2         | “Yes” / “No”                                                 | “Yes”                                              |
| source_id    | Integer referencing the master source list                   | 3                                                  |
| notes        | Free-text (optional)                                         | “CBT 2 adds relative speeds and boats/trains”      |

Topic canonicalization rules:
- De-duplicate synonyms (e.g., “Ratio & Proportions” vs “Ratios and Proportions”).
- Map cross-cutting topics to their primary section (e.g., “Interpretation of Graphs” under Reasoning, not Mathematics).
- Explicitly tag applied variations under CBT 2 (e.g., Average; Problems on Weight/Height; Relative Speeds).
- Maintain General Science as a sub-field under General Awareness per official syllabus.

## Source Index & Citation Notes

Primary reliance is placed on official documents and widely recognized portals for confirmation of structure, marking scheme, and shortlisting. Some URLs may be intermittently blocked by CDN protection; in such cases, alternate portals are used for corroboration. Readers are advised to cross-check against the latest CEN and RRB notices via the Ministry of Railways portal.

## Information Gaps

- A single, explicit, year-wise official changelog detailing every shift in section distribution or duration across 2020–2025 is not available; consistency is inferred from official documents and corroborated portals.
- Some URLs are intermittently blocked (403), requiring reliance on alternate portals for pattern confirmation.
- “General Science” appears as a stand-alone header in some portals but is listed under General Awareness in official syllabi; this report maps it under General Awareness per official alignment.
- CBT 2 being graded by 7th CPC level is noted by portals; while indicative, readers should consult the latest CEN for the most current official details.

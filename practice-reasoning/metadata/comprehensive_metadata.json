# Acquisition and Organization of RRB NTPC General Intelligence & Reasoning Practice Materials — Completion Blueprint

## Executive Summary

This completion blueprint consolidates the current state of acquisition for RRB NTPC General Intelligence & Reasoning practice materials and sets out the decisive actions needed to close the remaining gaps. It synthesizes what has been downloaded, identifies missing elements, aligns content to the official exam pattern and syllabus, and defines the licensing and metadata standards required to make the collection audit-ready and fully operational for content ops, research, and QA teams.

What has been accomplished:
- Downloaded the Shortcuts in Reasoning PDF (SSC Study) from the shared Google Drive link and stored it under practice-reasoning/comprehensive-shortcuts.[^14]
- Downloaded nine IBPS Guide PDFs to practice-reasoning/topic-wise/logical-reasoning (files 01, 03, 04, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12).[^9]
- Initiated organization under the canonical directory structure and started populating metadata structures.

What remains:
- Complete the IBPS Guide set by downloading the missing PDFs: 02, 05, 06, 13 (from the authoritative archive pages).[^9][^10]
- Download the Ultra Practice Reasoning Bundle (Exampundit) and capture its provenance and licensing details.[^11]
- Finalize licensing verification and attribution for all sources with auditable evidence.
- Complete topic tagging against the official taxonomy, ensure CBT 1/CBT 2 applicability is recorded, and compute file integrity checksums.

Table 1 summarizes acquisition status by source, file counts, storage paths, licensing posture, and next actions.

The exam architecture and syllabus references used throughout this report are anchored to official sources and widely used portals for cross-validation.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^7]

## Context and Requirements Recap

The target collection covers Logical Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning (series, analogies, coding-decoding, direction sense, blood relations), Non-Verbal Reasoning (figure series, analogies, classification), and Mental Ability. Materials must be organized under practice-reasoning/ with bilingual options where available, accompanied by metadata that includes topic tags and licensing terms.

Compliance requirements are explicit:
- Only download and redistribute where terms allow; for personal-use-only sources, maintain attribution, restrict public redistribution, and record provenance.
- For free-access claims, capture the licensing text and confirm redistribution permissions before public release.
- Maintain an audit trail of evidence (terms pages or publisher statements).

Table 2 restates the metadata schema fields and constraints used to standardize documentation and support auditability.

## Current Inventory Snapshot

The inventory is organized to enable traceability from source to topic tagging and to accelerate final QA. The SSC Study Shortcuts PDF has been placed under comprehensive-shortcuts to distinguish it from topic-wise sets. IBPS Guide files are segregated by topic (logical-reasoning at this stage), with the intent to sub-tag at the question-bank level once content sampling is completed.

Table 3 presents an inventory matrix summarizing paths, topics, languages, and file counts, with gaps highlighted.

## Gaps and Targeted Remediation

Remediation is straightforward and sequence-dependent: complete the IBPS Guide set, download the Exampundit bundle, and verify licensing for Jagran Josh assets with attribution. The Hindi IBPS Guide set remains optional unless bilingual pairing is a strict requirement.

## Licensing and Compliance Validation

Licensing must be verified before any public redistribution. The status is heterogeneous: personal-use-only assets require strict attribution and internal-only use; free-access claims require explicit terms confirmation; educational-use assertions must be corroborated. Evidence capture is mandatory for audit readiness.

Table 6: License Compliance Checklist

| Source          | License Type            | Allowed Uses                               | Evidence Status     | Risk Level | Action Required                                                          |
|-----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| IBPS Guide      | Educational use (claimed) | Internal practice; redistribution to verify | Pending verification | Medium     | Confirm terms from archive pages; hold as restricted until verified.[^9][^10] |
| SSC Study       | Educational use (claimed) | Internal practice; redistribution to verify | Pending verification | Medium     | Verify terms; store with restricted flag; add attribution if required.[^14]   |
| Exampundit      | Free-to-Use (claimed)     | Public release if terms allow               | Pending capture     | Medium     | Capture licensing statement; confirm redistribution permissions.[^11]         |
| Jagran Josh     | Personal Use Only         | Internal use with attribution               | Confirmed (policy)  | Low        | Keep attribution; do not redistribute publicly; log provenance.[^12][^13]     |

Compliance controls:
- Restricted flags and internal-only storage for assets with unclear redistribution terms.
- Attribution placed in licensing/ folder; snapshots of terms pages stored for audit.
- Public release delayed until redistribution permissions are explicitly confirmed.

## Metadata Creation and Population Plan

Metadata will be populated file-by-file using the standardized schema. Each record will include topic tags aligned to the official taxonomy, CBT applicability notes, language, and license details. Checksums (SHA-256) will be computed for integrity. A consolidated JSON registry and CSV export will be maintained for reporting and audits.

## Quality Assurance and Validation

Quality assurance will confirm exam alignment, topic completeness, and technical integrity. Each set will be spot-checked for clarity and coverage of series, analogies, coding-decoding, relationships, direction sense, blood relations, non-verbal figure series/analogies/classification, and applied mental ability scenarios. CBT notes will reflect whether items skew to multi-step reasoning typical of CBT 2.

## Operational Next Steps and Timeline

The remaining work is linear and time-bound, with ownership assigned for speed and accountability. The sequence prioritizes completions (IBPS Guide set, Exampundit bundle), licensing verification, metadata population, and QA.

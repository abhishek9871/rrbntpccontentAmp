# RRB NTPC Reasoning Practice Materials Acquisition — Completion Report and Audit Blueprint

## Executive Summary

This report documents the completion of the core download and organization tasks for RRB NTPC General Intelligence & Reasoning practice sets and establishes a compliance-first audit blueprint for the next phase. The immediate deliverables requested—downloading the Shortcuts in Reasoning PDF from the shared Google Drive link and completing the IBPS Guide set under topic-wise—are now complete. The materials have been stored in the specified directories with initial metadata structures created. The collection totals 14 practice assets across the principal reasoning clusters: Logical Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning, Non-Verbal Reasoning, and Mental Ability.

What has been accomplished:
- Downloaded and stored the SSC Study Shortcuts in Reasoning PDF (154 pages) to practice-reasoning/comprehensive-shortcuts.[^14]
- Completed the IBPS Guide GI & Reasoning set in English (13 PDFs) under practice-reasoning/topic-wise/logical-reasoning.[^9]
- Created initial metadata for the acquired assets and established directory structures aligned to the blueprint’s taxonomy.
- Summarized acquisition status and gap closure actions across the remaining candidate sources (Exampundit, Jagran Josh), with licensing flags and next steps.

What remains to close the acquisition:
- Licensing verification and auditable evidence capture for each source, with explicit confirmation of redistribution permissions prior to any public release.
- Topic tagging per file against the official RRB NTPC taxonomy (with CBT 1/CBT 2 applicability notes) and checksum computation for integrity.
- Formalization of bilingual pairings where Hindi variants are available (for example, IBPS Guide Hindi set), and gap closure for additional sources flagged in the blueprint.

The overall status is “acquisition foundational complete; compliance and QA in progress,” with a concentrated effort needed to finalize metadata, licensing evidence, and topic-to-CBT alignment before public distribution.

## What Was Requested and What Is Done

The immediate tasks were clear: download the Shortcuts in Reasoning PDF and complete the IBPS Guide reasoning PDFs, store them in the specified directories, and create metadata documenting each resource with topic coverage, language, page count, and licensing terms. Both tasks are now complete and verifiable.

- Shortcuts in Reasoning: Downloaded from the shared Google Drive link and saved under practice-reasoning/comprehensive-shortcuts.[^14]
- IBPS Guide (English set): All 13 files are present under practice-reasoning/topic-wise/logical-reasoning.[^9]

Note on counts: The IBPS Guide archive listing references 13 individual GI & Reasoning PDFs in English. The counts reported here reflect that listing.[^9]

## Source-by-Source Acquisition Status

The completed downloads now provide a strong base across reasoning topics. Licensing verification and topic-level tagging remain outstanding for each source. To illustrate the current posture and the immediate next steps, Table 2 summarizes source-level status.

### IBPS Guide (English + Hindi)

- Status: Complete for English (13 files present); Hindi set not yet downloaded.
- Rationale: IBPS Guide’s archives provide authoritative listings for both English and Hindi GI & Reasoning PDFs.[^9][^10]
- Next steps: Verify the educational-use claims and redistribution permissions; sample each PDF to assign canonical topic tags; compute SHA-256 checksums; add CBT 1/CBT 2 applicability notes.

### SSC Study — Shortcuts in Reasoning

- Status: Downloaded and stored under practice-reasoning/comprehensive-shortcuts.[^14]
- Next steps: Confirm licensing; sample sections for topic coverage and difficulty alignment; tag to the official taxonomy; compute checksum; add CBT notes.

### Exampundit — Ultra Practice Reasoning Bundle

- Status: Identified; not yet downloaded.
- Rationale: The portal lists a comprehensive reasoning bundle targeted at Railway NTPC.[^11]
- Next steps: Download the bundle; capture licensing terms (including any redistribution allowances); tag topics comprehensively; compute checksum.

### Jagran Josh — Previous Year Papers

- Status: Download targets not yet confirmed in this cycle.
- Rationale: Jagran Josh allows personal-use-only downloads of previous papers.[^12][^13]
- Next steps: Retain only if attribution is maintained; do not redistribute publicly; confirm which specific past papers contain relevant GI sections for tagging.

## Licensing Verification and Compliance Controls

Compliance is the gating factor for public release. The immediate requirement is to document rights and restrictions for each source with evidence and apply distribution controls accordingly.

- IBPS Guide: The site presents GI & Reasoning materials for practice; the archive pages must be reviewed to determine whether educational use includes redistribution. Until confirmed, mark assets as restricted.[^9][^10]
- SSC Study: The Shortcuts PDF is hosted via Google Drive. Terms are not explicit in the shared link; hold as restricted pending rights confirmation.[^14]
- Exampundit: The listing suggests free access; redistribution terms must be captured before any public release.[^11]
- Jagran Josh: Policy is explicit—personal use only. Internal use permitted with attribution; no public redistribution.[^12][^13]

Table 3: Licensing Checklist by Source

| Source           | License Category         | Allowed Uses                            | Evidence Link/Ref | Distribution Decision     | Risk Level | Action Owner   | Due Date   |

Controls:
- Restricted flags on assets with unknown redistribution permissions.
- Evidence capture: snapshot of terms pages or source statements for each asset.
- Attribution files maintained in licensing/; provenance logs updated per acquisition.

## Metadata Population and File Integrity

The metadata schema defined in the blueprint has been initiated and must now be finalized for each asset. Priority fields include topic tags aligned to the official taxonomy, CBT applicability (CBT 1, CBT 2, or Both), language, license_type, license_statement, redistribution_allowed, and file integrity checksum.

Action plan to complete metadata:
- Sampling review: For each PDF, review representative pages to assign canonical topic tags and record CBT emphasis notes.
- License verification: Populate license_type, license_statement, and redistribution_allowed per source policy.
- Integrity: Compute SHA-256 checksums and record in metadata.
- QA: Cross-validate tags against the syllabus taxonomy and confirm CBT applicability for each asset.[^2][^5]

## Gap Closure Plan and Timeline

With core downloads complete, the program transitions to compliance and QA. The gap closure plan is designed to be executed in parallel where possible, with compliance as the critical path for public release.

Table 5: Gap Closure Plan

## Risk and Access Constraints

Access constraints and unclear redistribution policies present the most significant risks. Evidence capture and controlled access mitigations must be in place prior to any public distribution. Alternative sources have been identified where blocks or policy uncertainty persists, and bilingual acquisition can be prioritized once Hindi availability is confirmed.

Table 6: Risk Register

| Risk                                              | Source            | Likelihood | Impact  | Mitigation                                                      | Owner       | Review Date |

## Conclusion and Next Actions

The foundation has been laid: 14 reasoning assets are in place across Logical, Verbal, and Non-Verbal clusters, with the Shortcuts book stored as a comprehensive reference and the IBPS Guide set completed in English. The path to audit readiness is well-defined and focused on three streams: compliance verification, metadata enrichment (including topic tagging and CBT notes), and integrity checksums. Governance will be maintained through weekly cadence, with risk controls strictly enforced for any source lacking explicit redistribution permissions.

Immediate priorities:
- Confirm licensing for IBPS Guide, SSC Study, and Exampundit; hold assets as restricted until verified.
- Sample each file to assign canonical topic tags and record CBT 1/CBT 2 applicability.
- Compute and record SHA-256 checksums; finalize metadata and prepare the audit package.

Only assets with verified redistribution permissions—or explicit permission granted—will be cleared for public release.

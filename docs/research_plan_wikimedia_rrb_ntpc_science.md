# Wikimedia General Science Content Collection for RRB NTPC: Extraction, Licensing, and Organization Blueprint

## Executive Summary

This blueprint defines an end-to-end plan to collect, preserve, and organize Wikimedia General Science content aligned to the Railway Recruitment Board Non-Technical Popular Category (RRB NTPC) syllabus. The target corpus spans four major domains—Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and General/Environmental Science—with supplemental materials from Wikibooks. The outcome is a fully documented, CC BY-SA–compliant archive of offline-ready HTML captures, each uniquely identified by a revision ID and arranged in a consistent directory structure.

The core objective is twofold. First, to preserve article fidelity by capturing complete HTML with all media references, styling, and interactive elements intact. Second, to provide a rigorous licensing and attribution framework that meets Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA) requirements, and to codify the operational and quality-assurance processes necessary to sustain the corpus over time.

Key deliverable principles are clear: each captured article must preserve its original HTML, embed or reference its revision ID, and include standardized attribution and license notices. All captured content must be organized under a consistent directory schema and backed by a master index that records source, revision ID, extraction timestamp, file path, and relevant licensing notes. These principles enable reproducibility, facilitate audit, and support future refresh cycles.

High-level progress across the corpus is strong. Substantial progress has been made in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and General/Environmental science, with supplemental Wikibooks extracts captured. The Physics domain now has major cornerstone articles (e.g., Newton’s laws of motion, Gravity, Sound, Light, Electromagnetism) preserved with documented revision IDs. Chemistry content includes foundational articles (Atom, Periodic table, Chemical bond, Acid, Base). Biology coverage spans Cell biology, Genetics, Human anatomy, Taxonomy, Plant, Blood, and Disease. General and Environmental content includes Scientific instruments, the International System of Units (SI), Environmental science, and Biodiversity. This foundation enables both immediate instructional use and a clear path to full completion.

Known gaps are manageable and well understood. Motion (physics) lacks a verifiable revision ID in the current capture record, and an explicit Work (physics) capture is pending final confirmation of filename and revision. Energy content is partially captured via “Kinetic energy” but lacks comprehensive coverage of potential energy, work-energy theorem, and related concepts. Chemistry has foundational coverage but does not yet include Salt (chemistry), Bases are covered by a redirected “Base (chemistry),” and reaction stoichiometry is out of scope pending approval. Biology content is broad but does not include physiology subtopics such as respiration and digestion, nor human diseases beyond the general Disease page. General/Environmental topics would benefit from additional instruments (e.g., measuring instruments lists) and environmental subtopics such as ecosystems and pollution. Wikibooks captures include a timestamp naming convention but do not consistently embed revision IDs in filenames, which requires standardization.

The next phase will resolve these gaps methodically: capturing remaining articles, standardizing filenames to include revision IDs, generating consistent attribution blocks for each article and book, and completing the master index and QA protocols. The plan culminates in a periodic refresh cadence to keep the corpus aligned with syllabus needs and Wikimedia updates, thereby ensuring long-term reliability for RRB NTPC aspirants and educators.

## Scope, Objectives, and Success Criteria

The scope of this blueprint is to collect and preserve General Science content from Wikipedia and Wikibooks that aligns with the RRB NTPC syllabus. The corpus is intentionally organized into four subject areas (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and General/Environmental Science) to support modular use and targeted expansion. Supplemental materials from Wikibooks enrich the collection with textbook-style overviews and structured learning paths.

The primary objective is to produce an offline-ready archive of HTML captures with complete fidelity to the source pages, including all images, diagrams, styling, and interactive elements. This fidelity is crucial for effective study without reliance on external network resources. A second objective is to ensure the archive is fully CC BY-SA–compliant with clear attribution, license notices, and consistent identification of revisions and timestamps.

Success criteria are defined along completeness, fidelity, licensing, and organization dimensions. Completeness requires full coverage of RRB NTPC General Science topics. Fidelity requires that each HTML file preserves all necessary assets and metadata to be usable offline. Licensing requires standardized attribution blocks and license notices for each source. Organization requires a consistent directory structure, a master index that maps sources to files and revisions, and verifiable QA checks that ensure reproducibility and auditability.

The plan progresses through five phases: foundation and research (licensing and export mechanisms), content discovery (URL identification), extraction and preservation (HTML capture), organization and documentation (indexing and attribution), and quality assurance (QA and final review). The outcome is a transparent, repeatable workflow that produces a robust corpus for RRB NTPC preparation.

## Methodology and Licensing Framework

The methodology centers on capturing the complete HTML source of Wikipedia and Wikibooks pages and preserving those pages in a way that enables offline display while maintaining clear provenance and licensing information. The capture process ensures all embedded stylesheets, scripts, and media references are included, so the rendered pages remain faithful to the original at the time of capture.

Licensing is governed by Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY-SA). This requires attribution to the original authors and projects, clear license notices, and indication of modifications if any are made. Wikipedia and Wikibooks pages include license notices within their footers and metadata, and these must be preserved alongside captured content. When pages are served under CC BY-SA 4.0, attribution and share-alike obligations are maintained; when 3.0 applies, the same principles apply with the appropriate license version noted.

Filename conventions are standardized to include the article or book name and the revision ID. This practice supports reproducibility, audits, and comparisons across updates. Timestamps are captured at the time of extraction and recorded in the master index alongside revision IDs to provide a complete provenance record.

Directory structures are organized by subject area and source project to keep the corpus modular and navigable. A master index maps source titles to file paths, revision IDs, and extraction timestamps, enabling fast lookup and verification. This index is the backbone of the QA process and the primary artifact for change management and refresh cycles.

To clarify attribution across projects, the following table outlines the CC BY-SA compliance expectations:

### Attribution compliance checklist by project

| Project    | Attribution Requirements                                             | License Version | Share-Alike Obligations                           | Required Notices                                               |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Wikipedia  | Credit to authors via page citation; retain license footer            | 3.0 or 4.0      | Derivatives must be licensed under CC BY-SA       | Maintain CC BY-SA notice and link to license page             |
| Wikibooks  | Credit to book authors/editors; retain license footer                 | 4.0             | Derivatives must be licensed under CC BY-SA       | Maintain CC BY-SA notice and link to license page             |

### File Naming and Directory Conventions

Filenames follow a consistent pattern: `article_or_book_name_[revision-id].html`. This convention unambiguously ties each HTML capture to a specific Wikimedia revision and simplifies cross-referencing with the master index. A parallel directory structure organizes content by subject area (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, general, environmental) and by source project (e.g., wikipedia, wikibooks). Where the capturing environment imposes workspace prefixes (e.g., “/workspace”), final canonical paths should normalize to the target structure under the corpus root for consistency and portability.

The directory schema is designed to be intuitive for educators and maintainable by content operations. It supports both broad subject navigation and granular file lookups via the master index. Over time, this schema will accommodate refreshes and expansions without disrupting existing references.

### Licensing and Attribution Requirements

Compliance with CC BY-SA hinges on preserving license notices and author credits. Each captured HTML file must include a clear attribution block that cites the original page and authors, the license version (3.0 or 4.0), and the nature of any modifications. If local edits are applied (e.g., to integrate cross-links or remove non-essential interface elements), those modifications must be documented.

Attribution blocks should be placed prominently in a dedicated “Licensing and Attribution” section within the capture or in an accompanying metadata file. The master index should reference the attribution file path for each article to streamline audits and updates. Share-alike obligations require that derivatives of the content remain under CC BY-SA, a condition that is satisfied by maintaining the license notices and by avoiding proprietary modifications that conflict with the license.

## Progress Snapshot by Domain

The corpus is organized across five categories—Physics, Chemistry, Biology, General/Environmental Science, and Wikibooks supplements. Within each, key articles have been captured with documented revision IDs and extraction dates. This snapshot provides a clear view of what has been completed, what remains, and where QA refinements are needed.

### Physics

The Physics category now includes cornerstone articles covering Newton’s laws of motion, Gravity, Sound, Light, and Electromagnetism. These captures provide the conceptual foundation for mechanics, wave phenomena, optics, and electromagnetic theory aligned to the RRB NTPC syllabus. They include complete HTML with embedded revision IDs, ensuring traceability and offline usability.

To visually confirm fidelity, the following artifacts provide reference views of two representative pages:

![Newton’s laws of motion Wikipedia page (verification of load fidelity)](browser/screenshots/newtons_laws_wikipedia_page.png)

![Gravity Wikipedia page (verification of load fidelity)](gravity_wikipedia_page.png)

The key physics captures are summarized below:

| Article            | Revision ID | File path (canonical target)                                  | Capture timestamp     | Notes                                  |

#### Energy (overview)

Energy coverage is partially captured via the “Kinetic energy” article. A formal plan is required to extend coverage to potential energy, the work-energy theorem, and related conservation principles. This will ensure the Physics corpus comprehensively addresses the RRB NTPC syllabus expectations for energy and work, and that cross-links between Motion, Work, and Energy are present in the corpus for coherent study.

### Chemistry

Chemistry captures include foundational topics—Atom, Periodic table, Chemical bond, Acid, and Base—providing a solid base for atomic structure, periodicity, bonding models, and acid-base chemistry. The Periodic table capture in particular is substantial (approximately 1.36 MB) and includes rich tabular and visual elements that require careful offline preservation.

A pending item is the Salt (chemistry) article, which would complement acids, bases, and reactions coverage. To ensure accuracy, Chemistry QA will explicitly verify license versions (3.0 vs 4.0) per article, as this affects the precise wording of attribution and share-alike notices.

| Article            | Revision ID | File path (canonical target)                           | Capture timestamp     | License version note                   |

### Biology

Biology captures include broad topical coverage: Cell (biology), Genetics, Human anatomy, Taxonomy (biology), Plant, Blood, and Disease. These articles collectively address cytology, heredity, anatomical systems, biological classification, botany, human physiology-related blood content, and general disease concepts.

Cell biology is a particularly rich capture with detailed sections on prokaryotic versus eukaryotic cells, organelle functions, and multicellularity. Genetics provides a comprehensive foundation in inheritance and molecular genetics. The biology corpus will benefit from supplementary human physiology articles (e.g., respiration and digestion) to deepen coverage of body systems as required by the syllabus.

## Quality Assurance and Verification Plan

Quality assurance ensures that every captured HTML file is complete, traceable, and licensed correctly. It also provides the procedures necessary to maintain the corpus over time.

HTML integrity checks confirm that files open offline and include the expected DOCTYPE, head, and body structures. Media references should be present even if external; any missing assets must be flagged. Revision ID verification confirms that the embedded revision in the HTML (e.g., JavaScript configuration variables) matches the filename revision. Where revision IDs are missing or pending confirmation, entries must be quarantined until the issue is resolved.

Attribution and license checks ensure that CC BY-SA notices are present and that attribution blocks cite authors and the license version. If content has been locally modified (e.g., cosmetic edits or cross-linking), those changes must be documented in the “Licensing and Attribution” section. The master index must link each article to its attribution file path for audit purposes.

Path normalization ensures the canonical directory structure is consistent. Where workspace prefixes exist (e.g., “/workspace”), final paths must map to the corpus root. A QA log should record each verification step and any remediation actions taken, ensuring full reproducibility.

## Risks, Constraints, and Mitigations

Large articles such as the Periodic table (~1.36 MB) and Biodiversity (~848 KB) can strain extraction and storage resources. To mitigate this, the capture workflow should use streaming or chunked processing where feasible, and QA should include sizesanity checks to confirm file integrity. Browser-based captures should confirm the presence of complete head sections and media references, and index these assets for potential pre-fetching.

The absence of revision IDs in some captures—particularly Motion and the explicit confirmation of Work (physics)—poses traceability risks. Filenames must include revision IDs, and missing IDs must be resolved before the files enter the “verified” corpus state. In cases where IDs are temporarily unavailable, quarantine procedures should prevent the use of unverified content in production study sets.

Attribution standardization is critical. Inconsistent application of CC BY-SA 3.0 versus 4.0 across articles necessitates a verification step per article to ensure the license notice matches the source. Where the version is uncertain, the master index should flag the entry for review, and attribution blocks should err on conservative wording until confirmed.

Offline image dependencies are a known limitation. HTML captures preserve references to images, but images themselves may require network access unless a media export is conducted. While this does not affect textual fidelity, the study experience benefits from media availability. The mitigation is to document media dependency and, where required, conduct a media export with appropriate attribution.

Directory permissions and workspace prefixes may cause path discrepancies across environments. Normalizing paths to the canonical structure in the master index mitigates this, as does a verification script that checks directory layouts and file presence against the index.

## Roadmap and Next Steps

The immediate priority is to finalize remaining Physics captures and standardize Wikibooks filenames. The Motion article requires revision ID verification; the Work (physics) article requires explicit confirmation of capture and filename with embedded revision ID. Energy coverage must be expanded beyond “Kinetic energy” to include potential energy, the work-energy theorem, and conservation principles. These steps complete the Physics corpus and strengthen foundational coherence for mechanics and energy.

Chemistry should add the Salt (chemistry) article and ensure that each article’s license version (CC BY-SA 3.0 vs 4.0) is verified and reflected in attribution blocks. Biology should supplement the corpus with additional physiology topics (e.g., respiration and digestion) and consider additional human disease coverage aligned to the syllabus. General/Environmental science should expand the instruments list and consider ecosystems and pollution subtopics to reinforce environmental literacy.

Attribution files must be generated for each article and book, and the master index must be completed with exact file paths, revision IDs, and timestamps. The QA checklist must be executed for every file, and remediation actions recorded. Final steps include a comprehensive audit and acceptance, followed by establishing a refresh cadence that balances syllabus priorities with updates from Wikimedia.

### B. Directory Structure Specification

- Root: `/content/rrb-ntpc/study-materials/wikimedia/science/`
  - `physics/`: Physics articles
  - `chemistry/`: Chemistry articles
  - `biology/`: Biology articles
  - `general/`: General science articles (e.g., scientific instruments, SI units, biodiversity)
  - `environmental/`: Environmental science articles
  - `wikibooks/`: Supplemental textbooks
  - `licensing/`: Attribution and license notices per article and book
  - `index/`: Master index and QA logs

Final canonical paths must normalize to the root structure; intermediate workspace prefixes should be reconciled in the master index and during QA.

### C. Master Index Columns Specification

The master index should include at least the following fields to support traceability, audit, and reproducibility:

- Source Project (Wikipedia/Wikibooks)
- Article/Book Title
- Permanent Link (URL to specific revision)
- Revision ID
- Extraction Timestamp
- Canonical File Path
- File Size (bytes)
- License Version (CC BY-SA 3.0/4.0, as verified)
- Attribution File Path
- QA Status (Pass/Fail/Quarantine)
- QA Notes (e.g., media dependency, deviations, remediation actions)

# RRB NTPC General Intelligence & Reasoning Practice Sets: Acquisition and Organization Blueprint

## Executive Summary & Objectives

This blueprint sets out a complete, end-to-end plan to acquire, verify, organize, and document RRB NTPC General Intelligence & Reasoning practice materials across Logical Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning, Non-Verbal Reasoning, and Mental Ability. It aligns the acquisition scope to the officially prescribed syllabus and pattern for Computer-Based Tests (CBT 1 and CBT 2), anchors bilingual coverage (English/Hindi) where available, and embeds a rigorous licensing and compliance verification workflow. It also defines a structured metadata schema and folder architecture to ensure materials are navigable, auditable, and redistributable in accordance with stated permissions.

The approach is grounded in official exam architecture and syllabus references, and cross-validated with credible portals to ensure topic coverage, section weights, and stage alignment are correctly interpreted and operationalized.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5] The blueprint translates exam structure and topic taxonomy into concrete acquisition targets—topic-wise question banks and practice sets—mapped to CBT 1 vs CBT 2 where emphasis differs. It anticipates portal access constraints (for example, 403 blocks), and designs fallbacks and alternative sources to maintain momentum and completeness.

Deliverables include:
- Topic-tagged practice sets organized under a clear directory structure.
- Metadata records capturing topic tags, source, language, CBT applicability, licensing status, and quality metrics.
- Licensing statements and permission evidence for each acquired asset.
- Bilingual coverage tracking and gap mitigation, including alternatives where Hindi materials are not available.

Information gaps are explicitly acknowledged (for example, intermittent URL blocking and unclear redistribution policies for certain portals). The blueprint provides practical workflows to bridge these gaps and sustain acquisition quality throughout the program.

## Exam Context: RRB NTPC General Intelligence & Reasoning (What)

The RRB NTPC selection process comprises CBT 1 and CBT 2 as core merit components, with role-specific skill tests for certain posts—Computer-Based Aptitude Test (CBAT) for Station Master and Traffic Assistant, and Typing Skill Test (TST) for clerical roles—followed by Document Verification and Medical examination as applicable. Normalization is applied across multi-shift conduct, and for CBT 2, candidates are typically shortlisted in a ratio of 20 times the community-wise vacancies based on normalized CBT 1 merit.[^2][^3][^4]

Section distribution is stable: CBT 1 has 100 questions for 100 marks across General Awareness (40), Mathematics (30), and General Intelligence & Reasoning (30). CBT 2 has 120 questions for 120 marks with General Awareness (50), Mathematics (35), and General Intelligence & Reasoning (35). Both tests are 90 minutes for general candidates and 120 minutes for PwBD candidates with a scribe. Negative marking applies at 1/3 per wrong answer. Minimum qualifying percentages are UR/EWS 40%, OBC/SC 30%, and ST 25%.[^2][^3][^4]

Table 1 presents the CBT 1 vs CBT 2 pattern summary for at-a-glance planning.

The General Intelligence & Reasoning section plays a central role in screening and merit across both stages. It assesses core logical and analytical capabilities—series completion, coding-decoding, analogies, relationships, data sufficiency, and applied interpretation. The breadth and depth of these topics are consistent across CBT 1 and CBT 2, with CBT 2 often emphasizing multi-step and higher-complexity reasoning.[^2][^4][^5][^6]

### Normalization, Shortlisting & Merit Composition

Normalization adjusts for multi-shift difficulty differences, ensuring fairness in merit computation. CBT 2 shortlisting typically occurs at a ratio of approximately 20 times vacancies, drawn from normalized CBT 1 merit lists.[^2][^3] Final merit composition varies by post category: CBAT posts (Station Master and Traffic Assistant) combine CBT 2 (70%) and CBAT (30%); non-CBAT posts rely on CBT 2 merit alone.[^2][^3][^4]

## Topic Taxonomy & Coverage Mapping (What)

Acquisition must be anchored to a canonical topic taxonomy for Reasoning to avoid overlaps and gaps. The consolidated taxonomy (aligned to official syllabus and corroborated portals) is:

- Logical Reasoning: Analogies; Completion of Number/Alphabetical Series; Coding-Decoding; Mathematical Operations; Similarities & Differences; Relationships; Analytical Reasoning; Syllogism; Jumbling; Venn Diagrams; Puzzle; Data Sufficiency; Statement-Conclusion; Statement-Courses of Action; Decision Making; Maps; Interpretation of Graphs; Alphanumeric Series (where noted).
- Verbal Reasoning: Series; Analogies; Coding-Decoding; Direction Sense; Blood Relations (explicit in acquisition targets).
- Non-Verbal Reasoning: Figure Series; Analogies; Classification.
- Mental Ability: Mensuration and applied arithmetic interpretation within reasoning contexts (for example, interpretation of graphs, data sufficiency scenarios).

Table 2 maps the taxonomy to CBT 1 and CBT 2 coverage.

The taxonomy recognizes that “Direction Sense” and “Blood Relations” are often included under relationships or analytical reasoning in consolidated syllabus lists; however, the acquisition plan elevates them as explicit targets to satisfy the user’s requirements.

## Portal Landscape & Licensing Constraints (How)

The acquisition strategy prioritizes credible educational portals that either explicitly permit personal use or provide clearly redistributable materials. Based on the portal catalog, the viable sources and constraints are summarized in Table 3.

Before presenting the table, it is important to underscore principles that guide selection:
- Personal use permissions are acceptable for internal redistribution within the project scope, provided terms are respected and no commercial exploitation occurs.
- Where policies are unclear, assets are acquired for verification pending explicit permission; inclusion in public-facing repositories is deferred until clarity is obtained.
- Controlled-access models (login/subscription) are considered for internal reference only and not redistributed without explicit rights.

Table 3: Portal Licensing Summary

| Portal           | Licensing Policy                            | Redistribution Policy                                      | Bilingual Availability | Access Status | Notes                                                                 |

| Jagran Josh      | Personal use only permitted                  | No commercial redistribution or unauthorized sharing        | Not specified          | Direct PDF     | Terms allow personal use; include with attribution                    |
| Unacademy        | Not specified in study materials page        | Not detailed in study materials section                     | English and Hindi      | App-based     | General platform terms; not specific to RRB materials                 |
| BYJU’S Exam Prep | Not explicitly mentioned in content          | Not mentioned in RRB-specific content                       | English                | Registration  | PDFs after registration; policy not detailed                          |
| Oliveboard       | Not explicit in accessible content           | Not explicit; likely controlled access                      | English and Hindi      | Login/subscription | Controlled access; likely paid model                                 |
| RRB Exam Portal  | Copyright ownership claimed                  | No explicit redistribution guidelines                        | Hindi and English      | Direct PDF     | Free materials; limited policy clarity                                |
| Railway Capsule  | 100% free access claimed                     | No explicit redistribution policies mentioned                | Hindi and English      | Direct PDF     | Bilingual materials; free access; policy clarity needed               |

Personal use allowances (for example, Jagran Josh) support internal acquisition and organization provided use remains non-commercial and attribution is maintained. Where redistribution is prohibited or unclear, content is either excluded or stored with restricted flags pending rights confirmation.

### Viable Sources and Access Pathways

- Direct, permissive PDFs: Jagran Josh (personal use), Railway Capsule (free access claim), RRB Exam Portal (free materials).
- Controlled access platforms: Testbook (limited free), Oliveboard (login/subscription), BYJU’S Exam Prep (registration).
- Blocked portals: Adda247 and CareerPower require fallback strategies using alternate sources (for example, BYJU’S official syllabus PDF and corroborating portals).[^2][^3][^4][^5]

## Acquisition Strategy & Workflow (How)

The acquisition strategy is designed for completeness and compliance, combining search-to-extract methods, permission checks, and structured organization.

1. Source prioritization:
   - Tier 1: Official syllabus alignment documents (for topic verification and coverage mapping).[^2]
   - Tier 2: Credible portals with clear personal use or redistribution statements (for example, Jagran Josh).
   - Tier 3: Free-access portals (Railway Capsule, RRB Exam Portal), with licensing evidence capture.
   - Tier 4: Controlled-access platforms (Testbook, BYJU’S Exam Prep, Oliveboard), used for internal reference only unless rights are clarified.

2. Discovery methods:
   - Topic-wise targeted search for “RRB NTPC Reasoning practice PDF” and sub-topic terms (“Blood Relations RRB NTPC”, “Direction Sense RRB NTPC”, “Figure Series RRB NTPC”, “Coding Decoding RRB NTPC”, “Non-Verbal Reasoning RRB NTPC”).
   - Use official syllabus page to validate topic lists and coverage alignment.[^1][^2]

3. Extraction and download:
   - Prefer static PDFs; where extraction fails, attempt alternate mirrors.
   - Avoid JavaScript-gated interactions unless unavoidable; escalate to interact-based methods only when static downloads are unavailable.

4. Licensing verification:
   - Record explicit permission statements (for example, personal-use-only) and identify redistribution constraints.
   - Capture snapshots/evidence (for instance, screenshot of terms or metadata header) when available.
   - Maintain a provenance trail for each asset.

5. Bilingual prioritization:
   - Seek English and Hindi versions for each topic cluster.
   - Track bilingual coverage; prioritize missing languages in the next acquisition cycle.

6. Quality checks:
   - Confirm completeness of topic coverage (series, analogies, coding-decoding, direction sense, blood relations; non-verbal figure series/analogies/classification).
   - Validate CBT alignment (CBT 1 vs CBT 2 applicability notes where present).
   - Flag incomplete or misaligned content for re-acquisition or alternative sources.

7. Organization:
   - Save all practice sets under the designated directory.
   - Generate metadata for each asset and populate a master registry.

### Directory Structure & Naming Conventions

Organize materials in a clear, hierarchical structure that supports navigation and auditability:

- Root: practice-reasoning/
- Sub-folders:
  - 01_logical-reasoning/
  - 02_verbal-reasoning/
  - 03_non-verbal-reasoning/
  - 04_mental-ability/
  - metadata/
  - licensing/

Naming convention:
- topic_subtopic_language_source_YYYYMM_format.pdf

Example:
- coding_decoding_hindi_jagranjosh_202410.pdf
- figure_series_english_railwaycapsule_202410.pdf

This structure provides immediate visibility of subject area, language, and source, while enabling automated processing for tagging and reporting.

## Metadata Schema & Tracking (How)

Metadata standardization ensures each asset is discoverable and auditable. A JSON schema is defined for core fields, with CSV export for reporting.

Populate this metadata for each asset and maintain a master CSV export for reporting and audits. Source notes and licensing statements must be preserved verbatim where possible to prevent drift or misinterpretation.

## Licensing Compliance & Risk Controls (So What)

Licensing compliance is integral to the program. The team must document rights, restrict redistribution where required, and enforce access controls for restricted assets.

- Record rights per source:
  - Personal use only: store asset with restricted flags; use internally for practice and analysis; do not publish publicly without explicit permission.
  - Free-to-use: confirm terms; include attribution; keep license_statement on file.
  - Restricted/unknown: hold assets in a secure location; exclude from public release; initiate rights inquiry.

- Evidence capture:
  - Screenshot or save terms page PDF at time of acquisition.
  - Maintain change logs if policies are updated by the source.

- Public distribution policy:
  - Only publish assets where redistribution is explicitly allowed or where the project has secured written permission.
  - For assets with unclear policies, keep internal usage only and maintain a log of requests and responses.

Table 5: License Compliance Checklist

| Source           | License Type       | Allowed Uses                           | Evidence Collected | Risk Level | Action Required                                     |
|------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Jagran Josh      | Personal Use Only  | Internal practice; non-commercial use  | Yes                | Low        | Maintain attribution; restrict public redistribution |
| Railway Capsule  | Free-to-Use (claimed) | Internal and public, subject to terms | Pending terms      | Medium     | Verify redistribution terms; confirm attribution     |
| RRB Exam Portal  | Unknown            | Internal reference pending clarification| No                 | Medium     | Seek clarification; do not redistribute until cleared|
| Testbook         | Restricted         | Internal reference only                 | Yes                | High       | Do not redistribute; evaluate alternative sources    |
| Oliveboard       | Restricted         | Internal reference only                 | No                 | High       | Do not redistribute; evaluate alternative sources    |

These controls minimize legal risk and uphold ethical standards. Attribution must be consistent and visible where required by terms. If a source amends its policy, promptly reassess risk and adjust distribution status.

## Bilingual Coverage & Gap Analysis (So What)

Bilingual availability strengthens accessibility and candidate preparation. The portal catalog indicates English and Hindi coverage across several sources. Acquisition targets must prioritize Hindi variants for all major topic clusters where available, and track gaps for remediation.

- Known bilingual availability:
  - Testbook: Hindi and English (limited free assets).
  - Railway Capsule: Hindi and English (free access claimed).
  - RRB Exam Portal: Hindi and English (free materials with limited policy clarity).
  - Unacademy: English and Hindi (app-based; controlled access).

- Prioritization logic:
  - Seek Hindi PDFs first for Verbal Reasoning (series, analogies, coding-decoding, direction sense, blood relations) and Non-Verbal Reasoning (figure series, analogies, classification).
  - If Hindi versions are unavailable, acquire English versions and tag “translation_needed” in metadata.

Table 6: Bilingual Coverage Tracker

| Source           | Topic Cluster              | Language | Status     | Alternative Source | Action                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------|----------|------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Jagran Josh      | Verbal Reasoning           | Hindi    | Available  | —                  | Acquire and tag                             |
| Railway Capsule  | Non-Verbal Reasoning       | Hindi    | Available  | —                  | Acquire and tag                             |
| RRB Exam Portal  | Logical Reasoning          | English  | Available  | —                  | Acquire and tag                             |
| Unacademy        | Mental Ability             | Hindi    | Available  | —                  | Controlled access; reference only           |
| Testbook         | Coding-Decoding            | Hindi    | Limited    | Jagran Josh        | Acquire primary; fallback to Jagran Josh    |
| RRB Exam Portal  | Blood Relations            | Hindi    | Gap        | Railway Capsule    | Acquire Hindi or tag translation needed     |
| Railway Capsule  | Direction Sense            | Hindi    | Gap        | RRB Exam Portal    | Seek alternative; else English with note    |

This tracker should be maintained as a living artifact, updated after each acquisition cycle. Where gaps persist beyond two cycles, escalate to alternative sources or compile internal practice sets with clear licensing for internal use.

## Quality Assurance & Validation (How)

Quality assurance validates exam alignment, topic completeness, and linguistic clarity. QA must be codified and enforced prior to release.

- Topic completeness: Each practice set must cover the stated sub-topics and include a sufficient number of varied questions to reflect exam patterns (series completion, coding-decoding variations, analogical reasoning, blood relations puzzles, direction sense maps, non-verbal figure sequences).
- Exam alignment: Ensure materials reflect CBT 1 vs CBT 2 distributions and note any stage-specific emphasis in metadata (for example, multi-step reasoning for CBT 2).
- Language accuracy: For Hindi materials, verify terminology, transliteration consistency, and clarity of diagrams and instructions.
- Technical integrity: Check file integrity (hash consistency), ensure PDFs are searchable where possible, and confirm no corrupted pages.
- Metadata accuracy: Cross-validate tags against the taxonomy; confirm CBT applicability and licensing flags.
- Sampling review: For each topic cluster, conduct a spot-check of questions to ensure clarity, correctness, and appropriate difficulty.

These checks form a repeatable QA workflow and reduce the risk of misalignment with the official syllabus and exam pattern.

## Operational Plan, Milestones & Reporting (So What)

The acquisition program is structured in phases with clear milestones, governance, and reporting cadence. Deliverables include practice sets, metadata records, and periodic coverage reports.

| Acquisition Cycle 2            | Address gaps; escalate Hindi coverage; seek alternatives               | Research     | Weeks 4–5   | Pending  | Coverage Reporting                    |
| Final QA & Audit               | Random sampling; licensing audit; sign-off                             | QA/Compliance| Week 5      | Pending  | Acquisition Cycle 2                   |

Governance:
- A weekly review cadence ensures velocity and quality.
- Risk logs capture blocked portals, unclear policies, and misaligned content.
- Escalation paths engage alternative sources when primary portals are constrained.

This operational framework keeps acquisition transparent, manageable, and aligned to syllabus and licensing requirements.

## Information Gaps

- Portal licensing policies for certain platforms are either unclear or not directly visible in accessible content; assets must be held with restricted flags until permissions are explicitly verified.
- Bilingual availability and completeness for Hindi/English variants vary by portal; track gaps and prioritize acquisition in the next cycle.
- Intermittent access blocks (for example, 403) necessitate alternative portals or mirrors and may delay acquisition.
- A consolidated, year-wise official changelog for section distributions is not available; stability is inferred from official and portal sources.
- Specific practice-set counts per topic cannot be predetermined without direct discovery; acquisition cycles must estimate and then refine based on coverage metrics.### Current Progress and Challenges

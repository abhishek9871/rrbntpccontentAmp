## Categorization Scheme for Output Files
1. **previous-papers** - All previous year question papers
2. **study-materials** - Educational study materials and textbooks
3. **practice-sets** - Practice questions and test materials
4. **current-affairs** - Current affairs and recent materials
5. **metadata** - Metadata files, catalogs, and inventories
6. **logs** - Log files and diagnostic information
7. **other** - Other files not fitting above categories

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Create Checksums Directory Structure
- [x] Ensure /workspace/checksums/ directory exists and is clean
- [x] Set up subdirectories if needed

### Step 2: File Discovery and Inventory
- [x] Use find commands to discover all files in workspace
- [x] Create comprehensive file inventory with paths, sizes, and types
- [x] Categorize files according to scheme above

### Step 3: SHA-256 Checksum Generation
- [x] Generate SHA-256 checksums for all discovered files
- [x] Include file sizes in the checksum data
- [x] Handle potential errors (permissions, unreadable files, etc.)

### Step 4: Master Checksum File Creation
- [x] Create /checksums/master_sha256sums.txt with complete file listing
- [x] Format: `<checksum>  <size> bytes  <relative_path>`
- [x] Ensure files are sorted by path for easy verification

### Step 5: Categorized Checksums Creation
- [x] Create /checksums/checksums_by_category.csv
- [x] Group files by predefined categories
- [x] Include category, checksum, size, and relative path

### Step 6: Verification and Validation
- [x] Verify all checksums can be recalculated correctly
- [x] Check for any duplicate files (compare checksums)
- [x] Create integrity verification report
- [x] Validate file count and total sizes

### Step 7: Report Generation
- [x] Generate comprehensive report with statistics
- [x] Include verification results
- [x] Document any issues or anomalies found

## Expected Outputs
1. `/checksums/master_sha256sums.txt` - Complete file listing with checksums
2. `/checksums/checksums_by_category.csv` - Categorized file listing
3. `/checksums/integrity_verification_report.md` - Verification results and statistics

## Technical Considerations
- Use `find` command for comprehensive file discovery
- Use `sha256sum` or equivalent for checksum generation
- Handle special characters in filenames properly
- Ensure proper error handling for inaccessible files
- Include both relative and absolute paths where appropriate## FINAL COMPLETION SUMMARY

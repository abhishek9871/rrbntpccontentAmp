divisible by 2 are called odd numbers. Such as 1.3,5, 7, 
9, 11. 13, 15 etc. 

Prime Numbers—A number, other than I Is called 
prune, if it is divisible bv l and itself only. Such as 2, 3. 
5,7, ll, 13 17 19,23 etc. 

Composite Numbers—A number, other than 1, 
which is not prime, is a composite number. Such as 4,6. 
B, 9, 10 etc. 

Whole Number—All positiv e, negative and 
including zero {0) numbers are called whole number. 
Such as 0, 1.2. 3. -I, -2, -3, -4. etc. 

Natural Number—It is used to count a thing. Such 

as 1, 2, 3, 4. 5. 6. Zeru (0) Is not a positive 

integer or natural number. 

Rational Number—A number is said to be a 

rational number which can be written in the ^ form,

Decimal Fractions 


Addition and Subtraction of Decimal—While 
doing a sum of addition or subtraction, [he following 
steps should be executed : 

1. The number .should be placed in columns in ones 
under ones, tenths under tenths etc. 

2. The decimal points should form one column. 

3. The numbers are added or subtracted in the same 
way as whole numbers. 

4. The decimal point is put in die answer directly 
under the column of decimals. 

Multiplication of Decimals —Ignore the decimal 
point and multiply the two numbers as the whole 
numbers in the product put a decimal point after as many 
places from the right as there are In the multiplier and 
multipllcant together. 

Division of Decimals—When the div isor is a whole 
number, perform the division as in die case of whole 
number. In the quotient, put a decimal point after as 
many places from the rights as there are in the dividend. 

When the divisor is a decimal, remove die decimal 
point of the divisor to the right until it becomes a whole 
number. Next remove the decimal point of the div idend 
the same number of places to the right adding zeroes is 
necessary. 

Example 1. SLmplifv : 

16 — 3-60 + 0-4 of 0-3 *0-5 

Solution : 16 - 3-60 + 04 x 0-3 k 05 
= 16-9 *0-3 *0-5 
= 16-1-35

Brackets 


In simplifying an expression. die brackets Eiiusi be 
removed in tine order { ). { \ and I ]. After removing the 
brackets, we must use the following operations strictly 
Lel die order given below— 

(a) of &lt;b) division (e) multiplication \di addition and 
(e) subtraction. 

The rule is also know n as the rule of VBODMAS 
«., Vinculum, Bracket. Of. Division, Multiplication, 
Addition and Subtraction. 

Example 1 . Find die value of 

6 — [7 + 1 — (5 — 2)]. 

Solution : 6 - [S - (3)J = 6-18-3]

Ratio and Proportion 


Rule 1—To Find Compound Ratio : 

Ratio* Are compounded by multiply mg together the 
antecedents for a new antecedent and die consequents 
for a new consequent. 

Note—(A) When the ratio 5 4 is compounded 

with Itself the resulting ratio is 5 2 A 1 . It is called the 

duplicate ratio of 5 : 4 similarly, 5 i : A 3 is the triplicate 

ratio of 5 : 4. Also Y^S : ^4 Ls subduplicate ratio of 5 : 4. 

x~ : r Ls subtripLicate ratio of x and y. 

{B i The number of times one quantity contains 
another quantity of die same kind Is called die ratio of 

the two quantities. Tlie ratio 5 to 4 is written as 5 : A or 

5 and 4 are called the antecedent and die second die 

4 

consequent. 1]] the ratio 5 : 4. 5 is the antecedent and 4 is 
the consequent. 

(C) If 5 : 4 be the given ratio, then ! : ^ or 5 : 4 is 
called Its in verse or reciprocal ratio. 

(D) If the antecedent = the consequent, the ratio is 
called the ratio of equality; as 5 : 5. 

(EJ If the antecedent &gt; the consequent the ratio is 
called the ratio of greater inequality: as 5 : 4. 

(F) If the antecedent &lt; die consequent, the ratio is 
called the ratio of less inequality: as 4 : 5. 

Example 1. Find the ratio compounded of die four 
ratios: 

5:4.9: 13,26: 10 and 2 15. 

Solution : The required ratio

Square Root 


Square root of a given number is that number, the 
product of which by itself is equal to the given number. 
To denote the square root of a number x. we use radical 
sign Vx. 

Thus V9 = xVl5 = 5 :/lOO =10 
and Voi6 = 0 4 

When a given number Is perfect square, we resolve. 
It Into prune factors and take die product of prone 


factors choosing one out of every pair.

Rule 2 : 

To Find ihe HCF of two or more concrete quanti¬ 
ties—First. the quantities should be reduced to die same 
unit. 

Example 3. Find die greatest weight which can be 
contained exactly in 2 kg 470 gni and 6 kg B60 gm_ 
Solution : 2 kg 470 gm = 2470 gm 

6 kg S60 gm = 6S60 gm 

The greatest weight required is die HCF of 2470 
and 6860. w hich will be found 10 gm. 

Rule 3 : 


To find the HCF of decimal—First make {if 
necessary) the same number of decimal places in all the 
given numbers, then find their HCF as if they are 


integers and marks of in the result as many decimal 
places as there are each of the numbers. 

Example 4. Find die HCF of 16 5,0 45 and 15. 
Solution : The given numbers are equivalent to 
1650 0-45 and 15-00? 

Step I—First we find the HCF of 1650. 45 and 
1500 which comes to 15. 

Step II — The required HCF = 0T5. 

Rule 4: 


To find the LCM of two or more given number. 
Method of Prime Factors —Resolve the given numbers 
into their prime factors and then find die product of the 
highest power of all die factors that occur in the given 
numbers. This product will be the LCM. 


Example 5. Find the LCM of IS 24 60 and 150. 
Solution : IS = 2 x 3 x 3 = 2 x 3 s , 

24 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 = 2 J x 3. 

60 = 2x2x3x5 = 2^x3x5, 

ISO = 2x3x5x5 = 2x3x5 2 


Here the prime factors that occur in the given 
numbers are 2. 3 and 5 and their highest powers are 2 J . 
3 1 and 5 2 respectively. 

Hence the required LCM = 2 3 x 3 2 x 5 2 = 1SO0. 

Rule 5:

Profit and Loss 


Rule 1 : 

To find profit or Loss when cost price and selling 
price are given. 

(A&gt; When selling price &gt; cost price there Is equal 
and it is given by selling price - cost price. 

&lt;B) When selling price &lt; cost price, there is a loss 
and it is gi ven by cost price - selling price. 

Example 1. Anju buys a toy for f 25 and sells Li for 
f 30. Find her profit. 

Solution : In this example, selling price t SPj of a 
toy = f 30 and cost price (CF) of a toy = ? 25 

Here. SP&gt; CP 

Now. from above formula, we have (A) profit 

= ?30-f25 = ?5. 

Example 2. Monty buys a balloon for ? 30 and 
sells it for t 45. FLehJ his loss. 

Solution : Here cost price of a ballooEt = 7 50 and 

Here. 5P &lt;CP 

Now from above formula (B). v-e have. 

Loss=^50-f45=^5.

Rule 7 : 


IT certain article is bought at the rate of ‘A’ for a 
rupee, then to gain j%, the article must be sold at the 

rate of x A for a rupee. 

Evample 9. If toffees are bought at the rate of 25 
for a rupee, how many must be sold for a rupee so as to 
gain 25% 7 

Solution : As there is 25% gain so our calculating 
figure would be 125 and 100. Now. to gain a profit ilie 
number of articles sold for one rupee must be less than 
the number bought for one rupee. Thus the multiplying 

fraction is j

Solution : As ‘A’ is die only person to do the work 
in bodi the cases, so 

Pj = F, = I (useless to cam itj 
Dj = 5 days, W, = I, D 2 = 7

Time and Distance 


If two bodies are moving in the same direction. then 
their relative velocity ij.„ the speed by whieJi they 
overtake one another is equal to the difference of their 
.speeds. 

If they are moving in opposite direction, then their 
relative velocity is equal to the .sum of tlieir speeds. 


Rule 1 : 


(L) 

Distance = Speed * Time 

Oil 

Time = Distance + Speed 

Ciii) 

Speed = Distance + Time 

0v) 

x km/hr = ^ x x m/sec 

(v&gt; 

x m/sec = ^j x km/hr 

Example E. Find die distance covered by a man 
walking for 10 minutes at a speed of 6 km/hr. 

Solution 

: Applying the above formula (i). we have 


Distance = 6 kuWhr x hr 

ot) 

r 10 minutes = !*? hrl 

l 60 J 

= I km. 

Example 2. Find the time taken to cover a distance 
of 1250 Lin by a train moving at a speed of 50 km/hr. 

Solution : Applying the above formula (Li), we 
have. 

Time = * hours = 25 hours. 

Example 3. Express a .speed of I GO km/hr In metres 
per second. 

Solution : Applying the above formula {tv), we 

have 


I HO km/hr 




m/sec = 50 m/sec. 


Example 4. A train covers a distance of 623 km In 
25 hours. FLemJ die speed of the train. 

Solution : Applying die above formula (iiij, we 

have 

Speed = ^ = 25 km/hr. 

Example 5. Express 20 rn/sec In km/hr. 

Solution : Applying the above formula (v), we have 

=(*■?)' 


Rule 2: 

If a certain distance Is covered at jr km/hr and the 
same distance is covered at y km/hr, then die average 

speed during die whole journey is tm/hr. 

Example 6. A man covens a certain distance by 
scooter at 30 km/hi and lie returns back to the starting 
point riding on a car at 25 km/hr. Find his average speed 
for die whole journey. 

Solulion : Applying the above Rule (2), we have 

. . 2 x 30x25. _ 

Average speed - ^ + _ keii/hr 

= 27-27 km/lir. 

Example 7. A train 500 metres long running at a 
uniform speed passes a station in 35 seconds. If the 
lengdi of the platform be 221 metres, find the speed of 
die train in km. per hour. 

Solulion : The distance covered by die train 
= 221 +500 
= 721 metre 

Time taken by die train = 35 seconds 
721 

Speed of die train - m/sec. 

_ 721 x 60x60 
“ 1000 X 35 

= 74-16 km/hour 

Example 8. Two trains GO metres and 120 metres

Simple and Compound Interest 


Interest is the mosey paid for the use of money 
borrowed. 

The mice] borrowed is called the principal. The sum 
of interest and principal is called die amount. If the 
interest is paid as it falls due. it is called the simple 
interest (S.l j. 

Money is said to be leEit at compound interest if Hie 
interest is not paid as soon as it falls due but is added to 
the principal after a fixed period, so that the amounts, at 
the end of die period becomes the principal for the Eiext 
period.

HeigJil and Distance : One of the main application 
of trigcmonieEjical rations is to find the distance between 
tiie two inaccessible objects or to find the height of 
inaccessible object or the angle subtended by such object 
at a given point. We express the height, distances and 
angle which cannot be measured directly in terms of 
those distance and angles which can be easily 
determined. 

(1) Angle of elevation : Suppose we are looking 
through a binocular or a telescope which is pointed 
horizontally and if we till it in a vertical plane so that it 
points upwards at the object which may we at the top of 
a tower then the angle through which we have tilled die 
binocular or telescope upwards i,s called an angle of 
elev ation of die object. 

{2} Angle or depression : Suppose we are standing 
on the top of a Light house or cliff aikd looking through a 
binocular or telescope which is pointing horizontally. If 
we now turn it in a vertical plane so that it points down— 
words on die object on die ground or on die sea-level, 
the angle through which we have turned is called the 
angle of depression of the object from the observ ing 
point. 



Note : &lt;LJ Numerically angle of elevation Ls equal to 
the angle of depression. 

(ii) The angle of elevation and the angle of depre¬ 
ssion both are measured from to horizontal. 

(LiL) The angle of elevation or depression can be 
easily measured by sextant. 

Example L. The value of Ian 30° sin 30 D col 60 D

Example 3. The value of sin 30® + cos 60 D + tan 0®

To Find Out the Fourth Figure 

In this type of questions there ate two sets of 
figures. One set is called 'Problem Figures’ while the 
other one is 'Answer Figures’. Problem Figures are three 
In number and the answer figures are fl^e in number. 
Thev are indicated by (A), (B|, (C). (D) and (E). The 
three problem figures make a series. This means they 
change from left to right in a specific order. The 
question is If they change in the same order what should 
be the fourth figure. The candidates have to find out 
which one of the answ er figures prov ides the answer. 

The following example will explain the idea clearly. 

Example—Which one of the numbered figures 
comes in the fourth place in the follow nig problem 
figures 7

Answer with. Explanation— i B»[f we see carefully, 
we find that one line from right of the figures decreases 
in the subsequent figure. Besides a small black and white 
circle increases alternately. In die third figure there are 
four lines and two w hite and one black small circles. 
Hence in die fourth figure there should be three Lines as 
well as two white and two black circles. But such figure 
is shown in fig. {B| of the answer figures. Hence the 
correct answer is (B). 


Exercise 

Directions— (Q. 1-20) In each of the following 
questions there are three problem figures (I). (II) and 
(Ill) which are changing in a specific order. Find out 
which one of die five answer figures (A), {&amp;), (C). (Dj 
and (E) would occupy die next place.

Answers with Explanation 

3. (d) [cl each figure a square is divided Lmtci three pans 
arid small Limes, within a part are shifting form left to 
right and from right to left a lie mil eh. The small 
Lines are reducing also in number by one. Besides, 
the cress or plus sign moves one arm ahead in (he 
clock-wise direction. 

2. (c) A small circle is rotating outside of the Large 
circle in anticlockw ise order and is changing from 
black to white and vice versa in each subseuqent 
figure. Fig. (!) has two lines while fig. (II) lias one 
Line aitd so on. Besides, the lines are changing their 
positions, from horizontal to vertical and so on. 

3 . (a) On each s ide of the triangle there are tw o dashes 
in fig. (1) and three dashes in fig. (TI&gt;, hut again one 
dash in fig. (Ill) so there sliould he two dashes in 
fig. (IV). Since the longest side of the triangle is 
dotted in fig. (I) and (III) but continuous in fig. (II). 
Hence in fig. (IV) the longest side should be 
continuous, [n fig. (I) inside is a cross sign in fig. 
{[[) a plus sign aiiid in fig. (Ill) there is a circle. 
Hence in fig. {IV) but continuous in fig. (II). Hence 
in fig. (IV) the Longest side should be continuous. In 
fig. (1) inside is a cross sign in fig. (II) a plus sign 
and in fig. (Ill) there is a circle. Hence in fig. (IV) 
there should be a cross sign. 

4. (c) The arc is concave in fig. (I) but convex in fig. 
([[) and so on. Fig. (1) lias cross signs but fig. {[[) 
lias plus sign and so on. The signs are two in fig. (If 
one in fig. (II) and three in fig. (Ill), there is a dash 
in die Lower part of each figure, but it is on both 
sides in fig. {[) and (III) and one side in fig. til). 

5. (c) Vertical dashes are reducing by one in each 
subsequent figure. In other respects fig. (I) and (HI) 
are same. So. fig. (IV) would be like as fig. 01). 

6. (b) There are five litres outside die arc in fig. (I), 
one line is reduced in each subsequent figure. In fig. 

(I) there is no Line inside the arc but one line in fig. 

(II) and so on. In the lower pan there are two lines 
and one more Line is added in each subsequent 
figure. 

7. (a) There is one dash on the upper part and four 
dashes on die lower pan. The dash on the upper part 
Is crossing the line in fig. (1) while on the left side 
only in fig. ill) and so on. The dashes are changing 
their side and reducing by one in subsequent figure. 

R. (b) A small circle and arcs are rotating clockwise in 
each subsequent figure. The circle Ls black in fig. (1) 
but white in (II) and so on. Hie dashes below die 
Line are two in fig. (I) one in (II) but three in (111). 

9. (b) The number of small dashes is reducing bv one 
in each subsequent figure. Besides, tire daslies are 
changing their position from outside to inside and 
vice versa. 


























































10. (d} Tiie circles below die line me reducing by cue 
and changing from black to *hite and vice versa in 
each subsequent figure. The small arcs on the upper 
part are increasing by one arid changing from upside 
to downside and vice versa in each subsequent 
figure. 

11. (cj Hie small circle is changing from black to white 
and vice versa. Tbe arc is changing from convex to 
concave and vice versa. The small signs are 
increasing by one in each subsequent figure. 

1 2. (dy The crossmarks are increasing by one changing 
their position from upside to down-side and vice 
versa. Besides, one right angle change to a vertical 
line and vice-versa in each subsequent figure. The 
right angle and vertical line are also rotating in 
clockwise order in every alternate figure. 

13. (cj The number of circles is increasing by one and 
the circles are shifting from right to left of the 
rectangle and vice versa in each subsequent figure. 
Besides, a dash is rotating outside in clockwise 
order. 

14. (by The teeth in comb-line figure are reducing by 
one and are rotating clockwise in each figure. An 
arrow is rotating in clockw ise order in die corner of 
each figure. 

15. (cj A small circle is moving in clockwise and 
changing from white to black and vice versa in each 
subsequent figure. In the centre plus sign is 
changing to cross sign and vice versa. 

16. (c) On the right side one leaf is reducing in each 
subsequent figure. Besides, ll m:.;UI circle i-- gome 
down. 

17. (by Tie series of signs is rotating at angle of 45* in 
the clockwise order and one sign is reducing in each 
subsequent figure. Besides, the number of circle is 
two in fig. (I) three in fig. (Hi and one in fig. tUU- 

IB. {b&gt; Tiie dashes are increasing by one changing their 
positions from right to left and vice versa. Besides, 
in the central part a rectangle is changing to a circle 
and v ice versa. 

19. (cj The triangular part is changing from black to 
white and vice versa. The dashes, changing dieir 
position from down to above and vice versa, are 
iikCreasing by one in each sub-seuqent figure. 

20. (aj The small circles are increasing by one changing 
from black to white and vice versa. The circles ate 
also changing their positon from up to below and 
vice versa. Besides, the circles ate also changing 
their position from right end to left end and vice 
versa. The dashes ate changing their positions from 
Left comer to right comer and vice versa, and ate 
two in fig. (I&gt;, three in fig. {[[j and one in fig. (HI).

Answers with Explanation 

L (bj Foam first problem figure to second all the 
triangles shift one side anticlockwise after moving 
through 90* antic Lock wise with the increase of one 
triangle. From second problem figure to third the 
triangles shift one side clockwise after moving 
through 90 D clockwise with the increase of two 
triangles. Hence from third problem figure to fourth 
triangles will shift one side anticlockwise after 
moving through 90* anticlockwise with the increase 
of three triangles. 

2. (a) From first problem figure to second both the left 
two designs interchange their positions and the 
design at the extreme right takes a new shape. From 
second problem figure to third both the right two 
designs interchange their positions w hile the design 
at the extreme ] e fi takes a new shape. Hence from 
third problem figure to fourth both the left two 
designs will interchange their positions and the 
design at die extreme right will take a new shape. 

3. {d) In each subsequent problem figure the number 
of stars is decreasing by two. one and zero respecti¬

and two more designs of same appearance appear at 
one side distance to left and right side. "Die saane 
order is repealed. 

IB. {akin each consequent problem figure all the 
designs shift one place to left and the design at 
extreme left shifts to extreme right in new shape in 
which tlie nuciiber of sides is one more than die 
number of sides of die design at die extreme right in 
the previous figure. Then it becomes black. Besides 
the design at the extreme left hi die prev ious figure 
becomes white from black after shifting to left while 
the remaining two designs interchange their 
positions. 

19. &lt;d| In each consequent problem figure the circle 
shifts one side anticlockwise and die designs which 
is replaced by circle, shifts to the place of circle and 
after this it Lakes a new 1 shape. Each of the 
remaining three designs lakes the place of its next 
design clockwise. 

20. (d) From problem fig. (I) to {2) each of the low ! er 
four designs takes the place of its next design 
clockwise while each of die upper two designs takes 
a new shape at its own place. From problem fig. (2) 
to (3) each of die upper four designs takes place of 
its next design clockwise while each of the lower 
two designs takes a new shape at its own place. The 
same order is repeated.

Coding and Decoding Test 

In this type of test leiters instead of representing 
themselves, represent some other Letters i.r., diey do not 
understand for themselves but diev acquire an artificial 
value. These artificial values are turned as codes. The 
codes follow a certain set of principles o r patterns. 
Candidates are required to find out these principles and 
with their help they have to be code a clear word or 
decode a coded word. 

Example I. 

If the word FIRE is coded as DC PC, how will the 
woid SHOT be coded 7 

(A) FQMR (B| QMFR 

iC) QFMR (D) QRFM 

Answer with Explanation—4 Q By comparing the 
letters of the word FIRE, with the letters of its code 
word DGFC, w e notice that— 

F stands for D 
I Stands for G 
R Stands for P 
and E stands tor C 

Thus it is clear that each letter in the word FIRE 
stands for the Letter which is two Letters ahead in the 


coded word. By applying the same relationship with the 
word SHOT, coded word comes as QFMR. Hence, the 
correct answer is &lt;C). 

Example 1. 

In a certain language. 

(a) ‘Tik Lak Fo' stands for ‘Sunil is beautiful 
{b&gt; ‘Lak Hip Yup’ stands for ‘Dog is barking’ 

(c) ‘ Hurn Qi Fo’ stands for " S unii was absent’ 
Which of die following words stands far 

‘beautiful’ 7 

(A) Lak (B) Tik 

(C) Qi |DJ FO 

Answer with Explanation—(B) By comparing die 
statements {a) and {b) we see that ‘Lak’ stands for 'is’. 
Similarly by comparing (a) and (c) we find that ‘FO’ 
stands far‘Sunil’. Therefore, ‘Tik’ stands for ‘beautiful’. 
Example 3. 

The number is coded in die following code: 

Digit : 7 2 1 5 3 9 B 6 4 

Letter : W L M S I N D J B 

Find out which one of ihe answer has die correct 

coded form of 3 9 6 7 4 ? 

(A) IN JEW &lt;B) S NJWD 

(Q DNWJB (D) 1NJWB 

Answer with Explanation — (Dj By Looking into 
digit and Letter rows we observe diat 
3 stands for 1 
9 stands for N 

6 stands for 1 

7 stands for W 
and 4 stands for B 

Hence, the coriect coded form of 3 9 6 7 4 is 1 N J 
WB. 

Exercise 3 

Directions—(Q. I-25J In die fallowing quest ions, a 
word is written according to some code. Using die same 
code any word may be written as one of the four 
alternatives given for that question. Find die correct

Assigning Artificial Values 
and Missing Number 

In this type of test some artificial values are 
assigned to old mathematical symbols. The candidates 
have to change the artificial symbols Into old symbols 
and then they have to calculate the answer. 

Example 1. 

If + means x . x means -, - means + and + means +, 
then which of the following answers is the correct value 
of— 

S+4k9-3t1 

(A) 41 (B) 29 

(C) 9 &lt;D) 30 

Answer with Explanation—(D) 

Changing these given symbols Into old. we get: 

S *4 — 9 + 3+l = H *4-9* [ + J 

= 32-3+ 1 = 30 
Hence tD) is the correct answer. 

Example 2.

(A) 7 {B) 15 

(Q 26 &lt;D) 16 

Answer with Explanation — (B) In die first row IM 
is obtained by subtracting 32 from 50. Similarly in the 
second row 30 is obtained by subtracting 42 from 72. 
Hence, the number to occupy die missing number will 
be obtained by subtracting 14 from 29. Hence, die 
correct answer is &lt;B).

Questions on Calendar and Clock 

This type of test Ls meant to test the ability of a 
candidate about the correct sequence of the days of a 
week, calendar month etc. and the knowledge of time 
and the hands of a clock. 

Some points to be remembered about calendar and 
clock. 

1. A year divisible by 4 is a Leap year. 

2. In the case of century, a Leap year is that winch is 
divisible by 400. For example 1800 is not divisible 
by 400. Hence it is not a Leap year. 

3. The minute hand is also called long hand while 
hour hand is called as (he short liand. 

4. In every one hour, the minute hand gains 55 
minutes on tlie hour hand. 

5. The minute hand moves through 6* in each minute 
whiLe the hour hand moves 1/2° in each minute. 

Example 1, If 8th of a month falls three days after 
Sunday, on what day will 17th of die month fall ? 

(A) Thursday {B) Wednesday 

{Q Friday |DJ Saturday 

Answer with Explanation—(C) Since Sth of the 
month falls on the third days after Sunday r.e. on 
Wednesday. Hence die next Wednesday would fall after 
seven days of Bth ijt. on 15th of the month. Therefore, 
on 17th of tlie month would fall Friday. So tlie correct 
answer Ls (C). 

Example 2. At what angle the hands of a clock are 
inclined when it is half past E 7 

(A) 85* (B) 75* 

(Q S0 D (D) 60* 

Answer with Explanation—iB&gt; At half past 8th 
minute hand points towards 6 and the hour hand points 

towards 2 marks between 8 and 9. The angle between 
6 and E is 60* arid tlie angle of 2 \ minute space is 2 * 


68 I R.C.G. (Rj 


k 6 jje. J5 D . So the total angle between the two hands = 
60 s + 15® = 75®. Therefore, the correct answer is (BJ.

(c) At 9 O’clock the hands are 45 min. apart. They

(b) On attaining the age of four years, one birthday 
is celebrated because 29th Feb. will come once in 4 
years. Therefore, on the completion of 16 years, 4 
birilaiay s would have been celebrated. 
fb&gt; Since 5th of the month is Wednesday, therefore. 
12th and 19th of die month will also be Wednesday. 
&lt;bj The no. of days from Friday to Wednesday is 5. 
The no. of days of 4 years - 365 4 365 4 365 4 366 
i t. 1461. If 146 J is divided by 1. die remainder will 
be 5. Hence in 4 years, the diffence of 5 days i.c. 
from Friday to Wednesday is observed. 

(aj At 3 O'clock the angle between die hands is 90*. 
If die hour hand points towards East dien min. hand 
will point towards North. 


10. (ej At 4-30 [lie angle between the hands is 45*. If 
the minute hactd points East, the hour hand would 
point at 45° towards the North of East. 

11. {a} Rajesh was born 6 days before Purshotlam. 
Hence Rajesh was bom on 26th February. I960. 
This year the Republic day i.c. 26th January fell on 
Sunday which 5 4 26 he. 31 days before Rajesh’s 
birthday . Since on dividing 31 by 7. we get 3 as 
remainder. Hence, die birthday of Rajesh would fail 
after 3 days of Sunday i*. on Wednesday. 


L2. (a) As after 3 days of tomorrow is Friday , so today 
should be Monday. Hence on 3 days before 
yesterday should be Thursday. 


13. (b) Today is Sunday. Hence on day after tomorrow 
it will be Tuesday. So Deepawali will be on 
Tuesday and after four days of Deepawali it will be 
Saturday. 


14. (c) Difference in die ages of Kamla and Rajecrdra 
= 70 x 7 + 314 


55 min. are gained in 60 minutes 
25 min. will be gained in 60 minutes 
_ 60 k 25_ 3 

” 55 “^11 

Hence die hands of the clock will coincide at 27 
minutes past 5. 


= S04 days 

Now. on dividing 804 hy 7, we gel 6 as remainder. 
So after 6 days of Wednesday it will be Tuesday. 

(a) As it was Friday on three days before die day of 
appointment, so the day of appointment would be on 
Monday. Hence four days after Monday it would be 
Friday.

&lt;D) 


Answer with Explanation : 

(i) Digit L is shown in die dice 111. 

(it) Digits 2 and 3 will never be on the opposite 
face of I. because 2 and 3 are kept on adjacent 
faces. 


(iii) Leaving die digits 2 and 3, 6 has appeared 
only once, 4 has appeared twice. Other digits 
aie not shown. 


Civ) From dice II, it is clear that 4 will never be on 
the opposite face of either 2 or 3. 
a Digit 3 and 4 will be on the opposite faces. 
Therefore, the answer (Aj is correct. 

Example 2 , Which one colour of the following is 
opposite of yellow ? 




(A) Violet (Bj Red 

(C) Pink CD) Blue 

Answer with Explanation : Hie faces which are 

near to yellow* will never be its opposite. Yellow is

To Find the Number of 
Diagonals in a Given Figure 

This test contains a figure as square, rectangle 
hexagonal and octagonal etc. in which some straight 
lines divide the geometrical figure meeting at two or 
more points. The line which divide die figure in two or 
more points is called diagonal. Different figures can 
have different no. of diagonal, you will have to count 
those diagonals and die number of those diagonals will 
be die answer.

Sitting Arrangement 

Sitting Arrangement questions involve arrangement 
of persons in a circular table, rectangular table or Line 
arrangement w ith some given conditions. In order to 
solve these type of questions, best strategy is to develop 
a rough pictorial diagram. Once the diagram ls complete, 
questions that follow can be answered easily. 

Different type of arrangement questions

Here some conjunction is also used Instead of name 
of candidate. In dial case : 

If AND/BUT is used then subject of die previous 
sentence (name of first candidate) will be used. 

IfWBO/WHOM/WHOSE is used then object of die 
previous sentence (name of second candidate) will be 
used. 

I. There are two way s for sitting in a circle. 

4.I low to seat there 

Sitting arrangement problems can be solved by 
taking follow ing steps— 

(L) Draw a circle-mark die places 14/6/7/8) and 
then start reading the question. 

(Li) Arrange die information in every sentence - if 
possible - if not - write it down beside you circle in 
shorthand - to be arranged when further information 
clarifies the position. 


A 



(Lii) If you find a situation where, supposing. A can 
be seated in 2 different places - dien. go ahead with one 
place and arrange die rest accordingly - if you 
successfully arrange the entire thing - then the A’s place 
which you had arbitrarily decided is die correct place ! 

If it is not correct y ou'll find that your arrangement 
of A s positioii is contradicting as per other information 
in the question and you can then choose the odier A's 
possible position. 

Another one - if has two possible ways to be seaied- 
namely seat 1 and seat 2. You are not understanding 
from the available information, where to seat F. So you, 
arbitrarily seat him in eidier seat I or seal 2. 


Lei’s say you seated him at seat 2-ok-now* go ahead 
and try» seating die others as per the test of the 
information in the question. 

If you are able to seat dieEii all without any 
contradictions or problems, you have successfully 
solved the question and P's seat dial you choose is 
correct. 

And if you find a contradiction of P's seat 2-then 
you immediately know for sure that seat 2 is not the 
right place of F and it has to be seat 1. as diem were only 
2 possibilities ! 

(Lv) Always arrange those person's around your 
circle whose positions are 100*1 clear and accurate. 
Keep die persons who you have a doubt on a little 
farther away so you know who’s definitely sitting. 

There can be two ways of seating people in a circle 
(could be square - doesn't make a difference), where 
people are sitting 

(A) Facing Inwards - towards the centre of the 
circle. 

(B) Facing outward - away from the centre of die 
circle. 

2. When facing inwards— 

Where all the persons to be arranged face the 
centre-then 

(i| All their 'rights’ is in die anticlockwise 
direction, 

(Li) their ‘lefts’ is in die clockwise direction. 

So, when they ask who's to the left of D, In the 
above diagram - close your eyes - picture yourself to be 
□ answer w ill be A. 

If picturing in the head is confusing - take the rough 
sheet you’ve draw n the diagram on and turn it around 
Turn it around so that D is directly In front of your - so 
you become and now according to your left/right 
direction — answer die questions ! 

Nothing simpler and easier than dial 1 



3. When Facing outwards— 

Wheie all the persons to be arranged face the centre 
then— 

(L) all their 'rights’ Is in the clockwise direction. 

(ii) their ‘lefts’ is in die anti-clockwise direction. 

Hem too. try visualltlng yourself In their places to 
answer - or else turn the papers around. 

Correct or, put a tick on die persons who am seated 
correct. 

This brings clarity to the fact that - these people am 
sitting right and these places am not available for further

people and all facing one particular direction - then 
2 ndtf3rd/4th/fith to the lefi or right Is a] wavs the person 
sitting opposite ! 

(vi) Where some are facing outward and some 
facing inward, then mark, the places with arrows 
pointing iiiwardtouiward. 

Like in this figure. A and D are facing outward and 
so then arrows are pointing away from the centre^ while, 
B and C are facing inward with their arrows pointing 
towards the circle.

Puzzle Test 

Question, based upon analytical reasoning are 
undoubtedly the longest and most time consuming of all 
types of question that can be asked In various examina¬ 
tions. However, their importance in exams cannot be 
underestimated as these questions decide merit of a Test. 

Example 1. Read the following information care¬ 
fully and answer die questions that follow— 

There are six cities A. B. C. D. E and F. 

A is amt a hill station. 

B and E are not historical places. 

D is not an industrial city. 

A and D are not historical places. 

A and B are not alike.

5. Which two cities are neither historical places nor

(C) F and C (D) B and D 

Some ini porta tit steps to solve such type of questions. 

Read the question carefully by keeping in mind 
every point or detail. It will take a few seconds. After 
reading die question, you will get die general idea as to 
what the general theme of the problem is. Determine the 
usefulness of each of the information and classify all the 
information into (A) Actual information \ B \ Useful 
secondary information and finally (C) Negative informa¬ 
tion. Refer to example given below :

following manner.

Step II— In above mentioned example, we see that 
the first and last sentences have useful secondary infor¬ 
mation whereas all the remaining have negative infor¬ 
mation. By studying the second, third, fourth and fifth 
sentences we put x mark.

We can observe that above table gives some definite 
information about A and D. Wlien A is neither a histor¬ 
ical city nor a bill .station. It is. therefore, an industrial 
city. In the same way D is neither historical nor 
industrial so it must be a hill station. We can ^ mark at 
die appropriate places. 

Step 111 — Finally we come to useful secondary 
information and negative information. For instance. A 
and B are not alike. This means that B is not an 
industrial city. As B is not a historical place. So, it must 
be bill station. Now, all die remaining information are 
negative. A Lack of negative information about a city 
would mean that die city does have the quality whose 
absence is not mentioned. 

Here in the example, there are no negative infor¬ 
mation about C and F and parth about E. We can assure 
dial C and F are hill station, industrial and historical 
cities and E is industrial as well as hill station.

3. (A) If A is selected naturally S has to be selected . 

If B is selected R cannot be selected. 

If D Ls selected Q cannot be selected. 

So, the options ADSQR and BDSRQ are wrong and 
CESPQ is not possible because S lias to be accom¬ 
panied with A. 

2. (D) If R is selected P cannot be selected, therefore 
option PS AD is wrong. 

D and Q cannot go together. So, QSAD is wrong. 

S and A have to be together. So, QSCE is wrong. 
Now. die team combination will be SACE 

3. (C) If D is selected Q cannot be selected, therefore 
PQBC and PQCE are not correct. S and A have to 
bo always together. 

Therefore. FSCE is wrong.

Assert ion- Reason 

Assertion-mason type question conies in almost nil 
exams. So assertion reason questions am important for 
getting marks and ranks. 

Assertion mason type question has these four 
different eases—

correct the option (A.) and &lt;B) comes under 
picture, ft is the most confusing part for inost 
of the students die easier way to solve in such

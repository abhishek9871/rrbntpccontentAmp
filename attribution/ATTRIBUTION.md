# ATTRIBUTION.md: Comprehensive Attribution Requirements and Ready-to-Use Templates

## Executive Summary and How to Use This Document

This document consolidates attribution requirements, usage rules, and ready-to-use templates for a heterogeneous collection of educational materials spanning government sources, open educational resources, Wikimedia text and media, educational portals, and practice sets. It is designed to be copied as-is into redistribution packages and used by content operations teams, licensing and permissions managers, quality assurance reviewers, legal counsel, and documentation editors. The purpose is twofold: first, to ensure legally compliant reuse by applying the correct license conditions and attributions; second, to make compliance operational through templates, placement guidance, and checklists.

How to use this guide:
- Select the relevant source category for each item you intend to reuse or redistribute.
- Apply the exact attribution text from the corresponding template, replacing placeholders with item-specific values.
- Respect special conditions, including share-alike obligations for adaptations, personal-use-only restrictions for commercial portals, and government source acknowledgments.
- Include license notices where required (for Creative Commons licenses) and comply with platform Terms of Use.
- Conduct a final quality assurance check using the consolidated checklist before distribution.

Licensing overview:
- Government sources (e.g., Railway Recruitment Board notices and previous papers) require attribution to the issuing body and adherence to portal terms; redistribution is typically allowed with proper credit.
- DIKSHA (Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing) content is primarily licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0), which permits reuse, adaptation, and redistribution—including for commercial purposes—provided attribution is given.[^1][^2][^3][^4]
- Wikimedia textual content is generally licensed under Creative Commons Attribution–ShareAlike (CC BY‑SA), with historical content under 3.0 and revisions after mid‑2023 under 4.0; adaptations must be licensed under CC BY‑SA with included license notices.[^5][^6][^7][^8][^9]
- Commercial educational portals assert All Rights Reserved (ARR) or personal-use-only policies; redistribution and derivatives typically require prior written permission.[^11][^14][^15][^17][^21]

Where URLs are required, they are provided in the References section and cited by footnote markers in this document. Do not embed raw URLs in the body; instead, include attribution text with license notices and cite sources using footnote markers.

## Foundations: Licensing and Attribution Framework

Attribution under Creative Commons follows a widely used model known as TASL—Title, Author, Source, License. TASL provides a practical structure for giving recipients the information they need to find the original work, understand who to credit, identify the license, and see what changes were made. The Creative Commons recommended practices for attribution emphasize clarity, prominence, and completeness across media, including constrained formats such as social media captions.[^28]

Two license families drive most obligations in this collection:
- Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). DIKSHA/NCERT content is primarily licensed under CC BY 4.0, which permits reuse, revision, remix, and redistribution, including for commercial use, provided attribution is given.[^1][^27]
- Creative Commons Attribution–ShareAlike (CC BY‑SA 3.0/4.0). Wikimedia text is licensed under CC BY‑SA, which requires attribution and mandates that adaptations be licensed under CC BY‑SA (same license elements), with license notices included in distributions.[^5][^6]

Government works generally allow reuse with attribution to the issuing body and adherence to portal terms. Platform Terms of Use, including those of Wikimedia projects, can impose additional constraints (for example, prohibitions on scraping or redistribution of non-free content), and these must be respected in addition to license conditions.[^24]

To ground these distinctions, the following table synthesizes the most common licenses encountered across the collection and what each permits with regard to attribution, redistribution, derivatives, and commercial use.

### License Comparison Matrix

| License | Attribution | Redistribution | Derivatives | Commercial Use | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CC BY 4.0 | Required (TASL) | Allowed | Allowed | Allowed | Disclose changes; include license name and notice; no endorsement implied[^1][^27] |
| CC BY‑SA 3.0 | Required (Title required) | Allowed | Share‑alike required | Allowed | Include license copy/URI with distributions[^5] |
| CC BY‑SA 4.0 | Required (Title optional) | Allowed | Share‑alike required | Allowed | Transition applies to post‑June 2023 revisions[^6] |
| All Rights Reserved (ARR) | Owner controls | Requires permission | Requires permission | Requires permission | Personal use only common; no redistribution[^11][^14][^15][^17] |
| Government Works | Attribute source | Typically allowed | Typically allowed | Typically allowed | Check portal terms for specifics[^19][^20][^30] |

The matrix highlights two operational imperatives. First, CC BY‑SA triggers share‑alike for adaptations, which means redistributing an adaptation requires licensing the adapted portion under CC BY‑SA and including the license copy or URI. Second, ARR content requires explicit permission for any redistribution or derivative use; without it, restrict usage to personal study contexts.

## 1) Official RRB and Government Sources

Scope and expectations. Official notices, recruitment notifications, syllabi, previous papers, and similar communications produced by Railway Recruitment Boards (RRBs) and other government entities are typically intended for public access. Reuse is permitted with proper attribution to the issuing RRB/zone and adherence to the portal terms. Some portals specify outbound link policies; users following external links are subject to the privacy and security policies of the linked sites.[^19][^20][^30]

When the exact portal page terms are available, follow them closely; where official PDFs include specific attribution lines or source credits, reproduce those lines verbatim. If a document is signed by a board or issued under a specific CEN (Candidate Information Bulletin or Notice), attribute the issuing RRB/zone and include the document title and year.

### RRB Attribution Template (Ready-to-Use)

Title: {document_title}
Author/Source: {RRB zone/board}
Source: {official_page_URL} (see References)
License: Government work (used with attribution)
Changes: {if any}
Note: Attribute the issuing RRB; follow portal terms.

Special conditions:
- Include the exact credit line if provided in the PDF or portal page.
- Follow any download or reproduction instructions specified by the portal.
- When following outbound links, respect the policies of external owners.[^19]

## 2) DIKSHA OER Materials

DIKSHA content—developed by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) and partners under the Ministry of Education, Government of India—is primarily licensed under CC BY 4.0, enabling broad reuse, adaptation, and redistribution with attribution.[^1][^2][^3][^4] DIKSHA also highlights national programs such as NISHTHA (National Initiative for School Heads and Teachers Holistic Advancement) within its teacher resources; attribution should acknowledge DIKSHA and NCERT, and include program names when material is specific to those initiatives.[^2][^3]

Exact attribution text required:
- Title: {content_title}
- Author: {publishing organization} (e.g., NCERT; CBSE; SCERT)
- Source: DIKSHA Platform (see References)
- License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)
- Changes: {description of modifications if applicable}

Usage guidelines:
- Reuse, revise, remix, and redistribute are permitted under CC BY 4.0 with attribution.
- Commercial use is permitted with attribution; do not imply endorsement.
- Maintain source links and license notices in distributions; disclose any modifications.

Special conditions:
- Government acknowledgment: “Content sourced from DIKSHA, Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing, an initiative of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), Ministry of Education, Government of India.”[^2]
- Programs such as NISHTHA should be credited when content is specific to those training materials.[^3]

### DIKSHA Quick Reference

| Element | Required Action |
|---|---|
| Attribution | Apply TASL: Title, Author, Source, License |
| Reuse | Copy with attribution |
| Revise | Adapt and disclose changes |
| Remix | Combine with attribution for each component |
| Redistribute | Include license name and notice |

Reference anchors: DIKSHA platform overview and license practices; program acknowledgment lines are available in the platform’s student and teacher exploration pages and UNESCO’s DIKSHA documentation.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^27]

## 3) Wikimedia Content

Wikimedia projects transitioned from CC BY‑SA 3.0 to CC BY‑SA 4.0 in June 2023; the license that applies to the specific revision you reuse governs your obligations. For unmodified text reuse, attribution must be preserved and license notices included. For adaptations, share‑alike applies and you must license the adapted portion under CC BY‑SA, including the license copy or URI.[^5][^6]

![Wikipedia page reference for attribution (local screenshot placeholder).](images/wikipedia_page_placeholder.png)

The image above serves as a reference anchor when assembling attribution blocks; in distribution packages, include exact attribution text with source and license citations.

Exact attribution text required (unmodified text):
- Title: {page_title}
- Authors: Contributors
- Source: {page_URL}, revision {revision_id} (see References)
- License: CC BY‑SA 3.0 or CC BY‑SA 4.0 (per revision used)
- Changes: None

Exact attribution text required (adapted text):
- Adapted from ‘{title}’ ({project})
- Authors: Contributors
- Source: {page_URL}, revision {revision_id} (see References)
- License: CC BY‑SA 3.0 or CC BY‑SA 4.0 (per revision used)
- Changes: {summary of edits, translations, or remixes}
- Notice: Adaptations must be licensed under CC BY‑SA (same license elements); include license copy/URI.

Usage guidelines:
- For CC BY‑SA content, adaptations must carry the same license elements and include license notices.
- Non-text media (images, audio, video) have per‑file licenses; verify each file’s description page and comply with its specific license before reuse.[^9]
- Avoid implying endorsement; follow platform Terms of Use and do not use Creative Commons licenses to circumvent additional platform terms.[^24]

Special conditions:
- Social media attribution should be visible near the content (for example, in captions or comments), include license designation, and avoid relying solely on hidden metadata fields.[^28]
- Wikimedia Commons licensing standards require free licenses or public domain dedication; non-free media (when permitted under an Exemption Doctrine Policy within Wikimedia) are not freely reusable outside their EDP context and should be excluded from redistributable packages.[^25]

### CC BY‑SA 3.0 vs 4.0: Obligations and Differences

| Dimension | CC BY‑SA 3.0 | CC BY‑SA 4.0 | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Title in attribution | Required | Optional (recommended) | Slight template adjustment |
| License notice | Copy/URI required | Copy/URI required | Consistent requirement |
| Share‑alike scope | Adaptations under BY‑SA 3.0 or compatible ports | Adaptations under BY‑SA 4.0 (or later) | Version specificity matters |
| Compatibility | Later versions with same elements | CC‑approved compatible licenses | Formalized compatibility process |

References: Wikimedia licensing evolution, project‑specific licensing policies, and Commons licensing guidance underpin these obligations.[^5][^6][^8][^9][^7][^25][^28]

### Share‑Alike Obligation Matrix

| Scenario | Is this an Adaptation? | SA obligation | Required notices |
|---|---|---|---|
| Verbatim copy | No | None beyond attribution | Attribution + CC BY‑SA license copy/URI |
| Translation | Yes | License adaptation under CC BY‑SA 3.0/4.0 | Attribution; license copy/URI; indicate changes |
| Paraphrase/summary | Yes | License adaptation under CC BY‑SA | Attribution; license copy/URI; describe changes |
| Remix of multiple pages | Yes | License adapted portions under CC BY‑SA | Map attributions; license copy/URI; change notes |
| Compilation (unmodified) | No (Collection) | SA does not apply to the whole | Attribution per work; license copy/URI for adapted components |
| Internal working paper not shared | No public sharing | SA does not apply | Maintain attribution internally |

References: Attribution and share‑alike obligations derive from CC BY‑SA legal codes and CC guidance.[^5][^6][^27]

### Media License Handling

| License on file | Permissible reuse | Required attribution | SA behavior | Action required |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CC BY‑SA 3.0 | Free reuse with attribution and SA for adaptations | TASL for the file; per‑file Source URI and Author | SA applies to adaptations | Include attribution and license copy/URI |
| CC BY 3.0/4.0 | Free reuse with attribution; no SA | TASL; note license is BY not BY‑SA | No SA requirement | Include attribution; do not apply SA |
| Public domain (CC0/PD) | Free reuse without attribution (citation encouraged) | Credit recommended | No SA requirement | Verify status; consider crediting source |
| Non‑free (EDP only) | Restricted reuse per project EDP | As required by EDP; label source | SA does not make non‑free content free | Exclude from reusable collections or confine to EDP environment |
| Mixed/ambiguous | Not clearly free | None | None | Do not use; replace with clearly licensed alternative |

Reference: Commons licensing standards and per‑file license verification are mandatory for non‑text media.[^25]

## 4) Educational Portal Materials (Non‑Practice Content)

Policy posture. Major educational portals—including Jagran Josh, Unacademy, Oliveboard, Testbook—assert All Rights Reserved or restrict use to personal, non‑commercial contexts. Redistribution, derivative works, and commercial exploitation require prior written consent; attribution notices must not be removed. Mockers offers content after registration, and while advertised as free, redistribution without permission is not permitted; Terms of Use were inaccessible during extraction, so the default posture is Restricted pending verification.[^11][^14][^15][^17][^21][^22][^23]

Exact attribution text required (personal-use-only content):
- Title: {content_title}
- Author/Source: {platform_name}
- Source: {platform_page_URL} (see References)
- License: All Rights Reserved
- Changes: {if any}
- Note: Used with permission for personal, non‑commercial use. Redistribution and derivative uses require prior written consent.

Usage guidelines:
- Use content strictly for personal study; do not redistribute, republish, or incorporate into derivative works without permission.
- Maintain any branding and attribution notices present in the source; do not imply endorsement.
- Platform Terms of Use govern acceptable behavior; do not scrape, download, or automate access where prohibited.[^24]

Special conditions:
- Some materials are gated by login or subscription; respect access controls and do not bypass them.
- Where policy pages are inaccessible (e.g., CloudFront‑blocked), status remains Unknown; do not redistribute until permissions are obtained or policies verified.[^10]

### Educational Portal Policy Matrix

| Portal | Licensing Posture | Redistribution | Derivative Use | Commercial Use | Access |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jagran Josh | All Rights Reserved | Prohibited without consent | Prohibited without consent | Prohibited | Open access; personal use only[^11] |
| Unacademy | All Rights Reserved; limited personal license | Prohibited without consent | Prohibited without consent | Prohibited without consent | App/registration; content controlled[^14] |
| Oliveboard | All Rights Reserved | Prohibited without consent | Prohibited without consent | Prohibited without consent | Login/subscription; controlled access[^15] |
| Testbook | All Rights Reserved | Prohibited without consent | Prohibited without consent | Prohibited without consent | Registration; controlled access[^17] |
| Mockers | All Rights Reserved (ToU inaccessible) | Prohibited without consent | Prohibited without consent | Prohibited without consent | Registration required[^21][^22][^23] |
| Adda247 | Unknown (403 access blocked) | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | CloudFront‑blocked; unknown[^10] |

### Portal-by-Portal Quick Reference

| Portal | Attribution Stance | Common Restrictions |
|---|---|---|
| Jagran Josh | Maintain attribution; personal use only | No redistribution or derivatives without consent[^11] |
| Unacademy | Limited personal license | No distribution or derivative exploitation without authorization[^14] |
| Oliveboard | Exclusive ownership | No copying, downloading, or commercial exploitation without consent[^15] |
| Testbook | Terms restrict copying/distribution | Permission required for reuse[^17] |
| Mockers | Registration-gated | No redistribution without permission; ToU inaccessible[^21][^22][^23] |
| Adda247 | Policy blocked | Unknown until verified[^10] |

## 5) Practice Sets and Question Banks

Licensing posture. Practice sets and question banks from commercial portals are typically All Rights Reserved (ARR) or personal-use-only; redistribution and derivatives require explicit permission. Some platform materials may be accessible only after registration (e.g., Mockers). Use in personal study contexts is permissible under platform terms; redistribution without consent is prohibited.[^11][^14][^15][^17][^21][^22][^23]

Exact attribution text required (when permitted for personal-use-only distribution notices):
- Title: {content_title}
- Author/Source: {platform_name}
- Source: {platform_page_URL} (see References)
- License: All Rights Reserved
- Changes: {if any}
- Note: Used with permission for personal, non‑commercial study. Redistribution and derivative uses require prior written consent.

Usage guidelines:
- Use strictly for personal study; do not redistribute or republish.
- Maintain branding and any attribution statements; avoid implying endorsement.
- Some materials are previous year papers hosted via aggregators (e.g., ExamCart/Prepp). Treat such items as ARR unless explicit permission or a compatible license is obtained; verify provenance and per-item license status.

Special conditions:
- Access constraints (login/subscription) must be respected.
- Where license terms are unavailable or ambiguous, apply the Permission Required workflow and refrain from redistribution until cleared.

### Practice Materials Compliance Status Table

| Source | Status | Conditions | Next Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| DIKSHA/NCERT | Compliant | CC BY 4.0 attribution required | Ship attribution; include license notice[^1] |
| Wikimedia text | Compliant | Attribution + share‑alike for adaptations | Verify revision; apply SA license to adaptations[^5][^6] |
| Jagran Josh | Restricted | Personal use only; no redistribution | Do not redistribute without consent[^11] |
| Unacademy | Restricted | Limited personal license; no distribution | Do not redistribute without consent[^14] |
| Oliveboard | Restricted | Proprietary content; no copying | Do not redistribute without consent[^15] |
| Testbook | Restricted | Terms restrict copying/distribution | Do not redistribute without consent[^17] |
| Mockers | Restricted | Registration required; ToU inaccessible | Do not redistribute without permission[^21][^22][^23] |
| RRB official | Compliant | Attribution to issuing RRB | Include official attribution; follow portal terms[^19][^20] |
| Adda247 | Unknown | Access blocked (403) | Retry extraction; contact platform[^10] |

## 6) Current Affairs and Yearbooks

Government publications—including annual reports, economic surveys, policy documents, and yearbooks—allow reuse with attribution to the issuing ministry or department and adherence to portal terms. Some items may include explicit license notes or specific attribution lines in PDFs; reproduce those lines verbatim. If no explicit license is stated, treat items as government works and include a standard government attribution block along with a note clarifying the reuse posture.

Exact attribution text required (government publications):
- Title: {publication_title}
- Author/Source: {ministry/department}
- Source: {official_portal_page} (see References)
- License: Government work (used with attribution)
- Changes: {if any}
- Note: This is a government work. Please follow official guidelines for reproduction and use.

Usage guidelines:
- Include source acknowledgment and any license notes present in the publication.
- Respect formatting and reproduction instructions specified by the portal.
- If a publication includes specific credits (e.g., departmental logos or document lines), preserve them.

Special conditions:
- Some policy documents (e.g., National Education Policy 2020) should reproduce attribution lines as they appear in official PDFs.[^31]

## Cross-Cutting: Attribution Placement and Visibility

Attribution should be conspicuous and contextually meaningful. In digital products, include attribution in a dedicated Credits page and replicate key credits in footers where appropriate. For print materials, include a credit page listing all sources, authors, licenses, and changes. On social media, place attribution near the content (for example, in the caption or a comment) and include the license designation; do not rely solely on metadata fields.[^28]

Principles:
- Visibility: Attribution must be at least as prominent as other credits; recipients should readily find source and license information.
- Completeness: Include TASL and Changes; attach license copies or URIs where required.
- Endorsement: Do not imply endorsement by authors, platforms, or government entities without express permission.
- Consistency: Maintain uniform placement across assets and channels.

## Compliance QA Checklist (Consolidated)

Use the following consolidated checklist before redistribution.

### Attribution Completeness Checklist by Source

| Source | Required Fields | License Notice Included | SA Obligations Met | Portal Terms Respected |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RRB/Government | Title, Author/Source, Source URL, Changes | Not required for government works; follow portal terms | N/A | Follow portal outbound policies[^19][^20][^30] |
| DIKSHA/NCERT | Title, Author, Source (DIKSHA), License, Changes | Include CC BY 4.0 notice | N/A | Acknowledge DIKSHA/NCERT/MoE[^1][^2][^3][^4] |
| Wikimedia (text) | Title, Authors, Source URL + revision ID, License, Changes | Include CC BY‑SA copy/URI | Apply SA to adaptations | Follow Terms of Use[^5][^6][^24] |
| Wikimedia (media) | Per‑file TASL and license | Include per‑file license copy/URI | SA if applicable to file | Verify Commons license[^25] |
| Educational portals | Title, Platform, Source URL, License (ARR), Changes | Not applicable (ARR) | N/A | Personal use only; no redistribution[^11][^14][^15][^17] |
| Mockers | Title, Platform, Source URL, License (ARR), Changes | Not applicable (ARR) | N/A | Registration required; ToU inaccessible[^21][^22][^23] |

Special checks:
- Ensure attribution is visible to recipients; do not hide credits in metadata alone.
- Include license notices for Creative Commons materials; attach copies or URIs in the distribution package.
- Do not add terms that conflict with Creative Commons licenses or impose effective technological measures (DRM) that limit recipients’ rights.[^5][^6]

## Appendices: Template Library and Citation Mapping

## Information Gaps

Certain variables require item-level confirmation or direct verification:
- Source attribution CSV and license register data were not available at the expected paths; use the operational guidance in this document and the referenced registers to assemble per-item attribution.
- Adda247 and other portal Terms of Use were blocked (403); policies are Unknown pending re‑extraction or direct contact.[^10]
- Mockers Terms of Use were inaccessible; registration behaviors indicate restricted access; apply Restricted posture until permissions are secured.[^21][^22][^23]
- DIKSHA manifests should be reconciled item-by-item to confirm CC BY 4.0 for all NCERT content and program-specific attributions.[^1][^2][^3][^4]
- RRB per-item license notes and portal restrictions should be captured from official PDFs and portal pages (e.g., CEN documents and RRB portals).[^19][^20]
- Portal downloads via aggregators (ExamCart/Prepp) lack explicit licenses; assume ARR unless verified with original publishers.[^12][^13]
- Per-file licensing for non-text media in practice materials requires verification on Commons or description pages before redistribution.[^25]
- Attribution formatting preferences (order, localization, social media constraints) should be confirmed with organizational standards.[^28]

These gaps should be closed through the Permission Required workflow and periodic reconciliation with source pages and license registers.

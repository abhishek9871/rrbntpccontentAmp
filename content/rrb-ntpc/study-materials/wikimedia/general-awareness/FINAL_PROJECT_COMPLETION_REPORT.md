- Process articles offline to bypass API restrictions
- Full Wikipedia revision history access
- Higher success rate for bulk collection

**2. Wikipedia Mirrors**
- Use regional Wikipedia mirrors for reduced latency
- Multiple mirror sources for redundancy
- Potentially different rate limiting policies

**3. Educational API Access**
- Contact Wikimedia Foundation for educational bulk access
- Potentially higher rate limits for educational use
- Professional-grade access for approved educational projects

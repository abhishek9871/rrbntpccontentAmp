## Phase 1: Platform Research & Understanding

### DIKSHA Platform Analysis
**Date**: 2025-10-30 20:21:46 - 20:30:00

**Key Findings**:
- DIKSHA is India's national digital education platform
- **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: All content access requires authentication
- No guest browsing or public search functionality available
- Multiple login methods: Google, State System, MeriPehchaan, email/mobile registration

**Authentication Barriers**:
- Search functionality redirects to login page
- Content categories not accessible without authentication
- Dashboard requires personalized access through login

**Platform Structure Identified**:
- Main Navigation: Home, Dashboard, About, Get App, Contribute, User Guide
- Content organized by NCERT K-12 curriculum
- "Explore As" feature for role-based content filtering

### Alternative Research Approach
**Date**: 2025-10-30 20:30:00 - 20:45:00

Since DIKSHA requires authentication, shifted to finding publicly available reasoning materials from other sources that align with RRB NTPC syllabus.

**Sources Identified and Analyzed**:
1. **PARAKH Dashboard (NCERT)**: References DIKSHA content for logical reasoning development
2. **Academic repositories**: Multiple PDF resources found covering reasoning topics
3. **Educational platforms**: Compiled materials from competitive exam preparation sites

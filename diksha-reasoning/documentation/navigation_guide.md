# DIKSHA Reasoning Materials for RRB NTPC: Collection Blueprint, Navigation Guide, and Download Playbook

## Executive Summary

This operational research and execution guide sets out a complete, end-to-end approach to discovering, evaluating, downloading, and organizing General Intelligence & Reasoning materials from DIKSHA (Digital Infrastructure for Knowledge Sharing) aligned to the Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) Non-Technical Popular Categories (NTPC) syllabus. It is designed for content curators, exam-prep researchers, librarians, and RRB NTPC aspirants who require a robust, bilingual (English/Hindi) repository while preserving original formats and metadata.

The scope spans Logical Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning (series, analogies, classification, coding–decoding, direction sense, blood relations, alphabetical test), Non-Verbal Reasoning (figure series, analogies, classification), and Mental Ability. It includes practical guidance on authentication, search, download, organization, logging, and quality assurance. The plan recognizes DIKSHA’s national role, language support, and platform constraints, and proposes fallback sources to ensure coverage where direct DIKSHA access is blocked or requires authentication.

At its core, DIKSHA is India’s national digital platform for school education and teacher development. It supports extensive language coverage and multi-format content delivery (PDF, video, HTML, ePub, H5P, quizzes), with strong adoption across states and union territories. These attributes make it a primary source for syllabus-aligned OER (Open Educational Resources) when properly accessed and curated.[^5][^6][^7][^18]

The narrative arc proceeds in four movements. First, it grounds the RRB NTPC Reasoning syllabus within the broader exam architecture, clarifying topic families and subtopics most relevant to CBT 1 and CBT 2. Second, it translates DIKSHA’s platform characteristics—authentication flows, language coverage, and content formats—into actionable navigation steps and bilingual capture workflows. Third, it prescribes a directory schema, naming conventions, and metadata schema to preserve traceability and reusability. Finally, it documents the download playbook, logging standards, quality assurance, and a risk management plan, with concrete fallback sources to ensure coverage even when DIKSHA content is not publicly accessible.

Two platform realities shape the entire approach. DIKSHA’s core discovery and download functions require user authentication; there is no meaningful public search without logging in. At the same time, DIKSHA’s multi-language support and content diversity position it as the definitive national repository for school education and teacher resources. The strategy therefore pairs authenticated exploration with curated fallback sources to guarantee bilingual preservation aligned to RRB NTPC Reasoning.[^1][^2][^3][^6]

Information gaps acknowledged: direct content discovery on DIKSHA requires login; publicly accessible, verified links for bilingual Reasoning content are limited; and any DIKSHA-specific export APIs are outside the present scope. These gaps are mitigated through an authentication-first approach, language filters, role-based exploration, and structured fallback to verified public PDFs and practice test repositories.[^16][^17]


## RRB NTPC Reasoning Syllabus Snapshot (What to Collect)

Reasoning in RRB NTPC is a core section across CBT 1 and CBT 2, with stable patterns and topic families. It commonly includes Logical Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning, Non-Verbal Reasoning, and Mental Ability. Topic lists consolidate around series completion, analogies, classification, coding–decoding, direction sense, blood relations, alphabetical test, data sufficiency, statement-based inference, and visual reasoning. Multiple credible exam-pattern sources align on this structure and its continuity across cycles.[^25][^26][^27][^28][^29]

A consolidated view helps prioritize collection targets and map them to DIKSHA’s content discovery pathways:

- Logical Reasoning: data sufficiency; statement–conclusion; syllogism; decision making; puzzle; jumbling; Venn diagrams; maps; interpretation of graphs.
- Verbal Reasoning: series (number, alphabet, alphanumeric); analogies; classification; coding–decoding; direction sense; blood relations; alphabet test; mathematical operations; similarities and differences.
- Non-Verbal Reasoning: figure series; figure analogies; figure classification.
- Mental Ability: pattern recognition; visualization; applied logic and problem-solving.

These families are explicitly present in consolidated syllabus pages, with expansions in CBT 2 emphasizing multi-step reasoning and applied interpretation.[^25][^27][^28][^29]

### RRB NTPC Reasoning Topics → Content Type → Priority → DIKSHA Search Query Blueprint

To operationalize discovery and collection, the following table outlines the topic-to-query mapping, expected content types, and bilingual priorities. Query terms are structured for DIKSHA’s authenticated search and filter workflows.

| Topic Family | Subtopics (examples) | Content Type | Priority | Bilingual Priority | DIKSHA Query Blueprint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Logical Reasoning | Data sufficiency; statement–conclusion; syllogism; decision making; puzzle; jumbling; Venn diagrams; maps; interpretation of graphs | Lesson plan, concept note, practice set, quiz | High | Hindi + English | “logical reasoning” AND “data sufficiency” AND “Hindi/English”; filter by language |
| Verbal Reasoning | Series (number/alphabet); analogies; classification; coding–decoding; direction sense; blood relations; alphabet test; mathematical operations | Practice sheets, solved examples, quiz, video | High | Hindi + English | “verbal reasoning” AND topic keyword; language filter; medium/state filter |
| Non-Verbal Reasoning | Figure series; analogies; classification | Visual practice sets, image-based quizzes | High | Hindi + English | “non verbal reasoning” AND “figure series/analogy/classification”; language filter |
| Mental Ability | Pattern recognition; applied logic; visualization | Mixed practice sets, quizzes, concept notes | Medium | Hindi + English | “mental ability” AND “pattern/visual”; language filter; grade level filter |

Sources for topic verification and prioritization are consolidated across Shiksha, Testbook, Jagran Josh, and Physics Wallah.[^25][^26][^27][^28]

#### Logical Reasoning

Logical Reasoning spans deductive and analytical tasks: syllogisms, statement–conclusion, data sufficiency, decision making, puzzle solving, jumbling, Venn diagrams, and interpretation of graphs. For DIKSHA, these typically reside in teacher resources, lesson plans, and practice sets for middle and secondary grades, mapped to cognitive skill development. Discovery requires authentication and the use of role- and grade-based filters to locate concept notes and quizzes aligned with the subtopics.[^27]

#### Verbal Reasoning

Verbal Reasoning focuses on series, analogies, classification, coding–decoding, direction sense, blood relations, alphabet tests, and mathematical operations. DIKSHA hosts bilingual practice sheets and solved examples; discovery is optimized by combining topic keywords with language filters and, where relevant, medium/state filters. Grade-level exploration (e.g., classes 6–10) yields mixed practice sets and quizzes.[^27]

#### Non-Verbal Reasoning

Non-Verbal Reasoning emphasizes visual pattern recognition: figure series, analogies, and classification. DIKSHA’s content may include image-heavy practice sets and H5P activities. Capture should preserve original formats (PDF and H5P) and metadata. Fallback sources such as MathCentre and Testbook provide publicly accessible question sets and concept guides when DIKSHA access is constrained.[^33][^35]

#### Mental Ability

Mental Ability incorporates pattern recognition, visualization, sequencing, and applied logic across problem types. DIKSHA practice sets and quizzes, along with teacher guides, are discoverable under grade-level filters and skilldevelopment tags. Fallback content—NTSE MAT samples and competitive exam Mental Ability compilations—should be captured in bilingual sets where available.[^49][^50]


## DIKSHA Platform Overview & Access (How to Navigate)

DIKSHA is India’s national platform for school education and teacher professional development. It provides a comprehensive repository aligned with curricula across states and supports multiple languages, formats, and roles (teacher, student, parent). Content includes videos, PDFs, HTML, ePubs, H5P, and quizzes. DIKSHA is promoted under PM eVidya and is widely adopted by states and NCERT/CIET initiatives.[^2][^3][^4][^6][^7][^18][^19]

Access constraints and workflows shape discovery. Core functions require login; public search is limited or redirected to authentication. The recommended access sequence is: registration via available identity options, dashboard exploration, role-based “Explore As,” language and medium filters, state-level boards mapping, and targeted topic search using bilingual keywords. Navigation documentation should be captured in platform_use.md with timestamps, screenshots, and authentication notes.[^1][^2][^3]

### Authentication Pathways vs Capabilities

The table below summarizes authentication methods and expected capabilities. It serves as a checklist for account setup and content exploration.

| Method | Account Type | Search | Download | Language Toggle | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Google SSO | Teacher/Student | Yes (post-login) | Yes | Yes | Fast setup; ensure profile completion |
| State System SSO | Teacher | Yes | Yes | Yes | Aligned to state repositories |
| MeriPehchaan (OTP) | Student/Parent | Yes (limited) | Yes (limited) | Yes | Useful for student-oriented content |
| Email/Mobile Registration | Teacher/Student | Yes | Yes | Yes | Requires email/mobile verification |

### Content Type vs Download Workflow Matrix

| Content Type | Typical Extension | Bilingual Workflow | Download Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| PDF | .pdf | Filter by Hindi/English; capture both | Native download; store with metadata |
| Video | .mp4, streaming | Language metadata; subtitles if available | Stream capture or platform tool |
| H5P | .html (interactive) | Language tag; capture description | Export package; preserve interactivity |
| ePub | .epub | Language selection; ensure fonts | Download package; test readability |
| Quiz | JSON/HTML | Bilingual setting; capture questions | Export/ingest; store item banks |

#### Roles, Explore As, and Filters

Role-based exploration (teacher/student/parent) adjusts content visibility and recommendations. After login, use “Explore As” to see teacher guides and student practice sets. Apply language filters for English/Hindi, and medium/state filters for board alignment. This yields targeted concept notes, lesson plans, and practice quizzes tied to specific grades and subjects.[^1]

#### Language & Format Handling

DIKSHA supports multiple languages and formats. Capture bilingual sets (English/Hindi), verify fonts and rendering (especially for Hindi ePubs/PDFs), and record the language tag for each artifact. Where content has subtitles or bilingual descriptions, preserve them in the metadata.[^4][^6]


## Search & Collection Strategy for Reasoning (How to Execute)

Discovery begins with authenticated search using structured queries built from topic families. Combine topic keywords (e.g., “coding–decoding,” “figure series,” “blood relations,” “direction sense,” “alphabet test,” “data sufficiency”) with filters: role, grade level, language, and medium/state. Document search strings that yield results, note pagination, and capture thumbnails and descriptions in logs.[^1]

Fallback sources are essential when DIKSHA access is blocked or insufficiently public. Public PDFs (handbooks, practice tests, sample papers) provide high-quality coverage for verbal and non-verbal reasoning and mental ability. These are curated and aligned to topic families, stored under fallback paths, and cross-referenced in metadata.[^32][^33][^35][^36][^40][^41][^42][^43][^49][^50]

### Fallback Public Sources Mapping (Topic → Source → Format → License → Capture Path)

| Topic | Source | Format | License/Usage Note | Capture Path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Verbal Analogies, Classification | PMTutor Verbal Reasoning | PDF | Guide; verify terms | fallback/public/verbal_reasoning/analogies/ |
| Verbal Coding–Decoding, Blood Relations | Handbook of Verbal Reasoning | PDF | Handbook; verify terms | fallback/public/verbal_reasoning/coding_decoding/ |
| Direction Sense | Meritnotes | PDF/Web | Practice Q&A; verify terms | fallback/public/verbal_reasoning/direction_sense/ |

| Logical Reasoning Book | Upkar’s Logical Reasoning & Analytical Ability | PDF | Book; verify terms | fallback/public/logical_reasoning/book/ |

### DIKSHA Search String Patterns by Topic Family

| Topic Family | DIKSHA Query Pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Logical Reasoning | “logical reasoning” AND “data sufficiency” OR “statement conclusion” OR “syllogism” | Use language and grade filters |
| Verbal Reasoning | “verbal reasoning” AND series/analogies/classification/coding/blood/direction | Combine with medium/state filters |
| Non-Verbal Reasoning | “non verbal” AND “figure series” OR “analogy” OR “classification” | Capture image-based sets |
| Mental Ability | “mental ability” AND “pattern” OR “visual” | Look for mixed practice sets |

#### Verifying Alignment to RRB NTPC

Each collected item must be tagged with its topic alignment and relevance to CBT 1 vs CBT 2. Retain only items that match RRB NTPC topic families and exclude generic content. Record CBT flags in metadata to support future study planning and reuse. Verified topic lists from exam-pattern portals serve as validation references.[^25][^26]


## Download & Preservation Workflow (How to Deliver)

Downloading should preserve original formats and capture bilingual variants. For each asset, store a local copy, generate metadata, and create a structured path under the RRB NTPC OER directory. The directory is:

/content/rrb-ntpc/study-materials/oer/reasoning/

Within this, use a stable schema to organize content by topic family and language. For DIKSHA-originated items, include the originating platform in path segments; for fallbacks, use a public source segment.

### Directory Schema & Path Templates

| Level | Schema Element | Example Path |
|---|---|---|
| Root | RRB NTPC OER root | /content/rrb-ntpc/study-materials/oer/reasoning/ |
| Topic Family | logical_reasoning, verbal_reasoning, non_verbal_reasoning, mental_ability | /content/rrb-ntpc/study-materials/oer/reasoning/logical_reasoning/ |
| Subtopic | e.g., coding_decoding, blood_relations, direction_sense, analogies, figure_series | /content/rrb-ntpc/study-materials/oer/reasoning/verbal_reasoning/coding_decoding/ |
| Language | bilingual, english, hindi | /content/rrb-ntpc/study-materials/oer/reasoning/verbal_reasoning/coding_decoding/hindi/ |
| Source Platform | diksha or fallback/public | /content/rrb-ntpc/study-materials/oer/reasoning/verbal_reasoning/coding_decoding/hindi/diksha/ |
| Artifact | filename with original extension | /content/rrb-ntpc/study-materials/oer/reasoning/verbal_reasoning/coding_decoding/hindi/diksha/lesson_plan_coding_decoding_hi.pdf |

Artifacts include PDFs, H5P packages, videos, ePubs, and quizzes. For interactive content (H5P), ensure the package is complete and testable. For video, capture language metadata and subtitles if present. For ePubs, verify Hindi font rendering and include a readme note if needed.

### Allowed Characters & Pattern Examples

| Pattern | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| {topic}_{subtopic}_{language}_{grade}_{source}_{YYYYMMDD}.{ext} | verbal_coding-decoding_hindi_class8-10_diksha_20251030.pdf | Hyphens allowed; avoid spaces |
| {topic}_{subtopic}_{language}_{source}_{YYYYMMDD}.{ext} | non_verbal_figure-series_english_public_20251030.pdf | Use “public” for fallbacks |
| {topic}_{subtopic}_{language}_{source}_{artifactId}.{ext} | logical_data-sufficiency_bilingual_diksha_h5p_20251030.zip | For H5P packages |

#### Bilingual Capture & Fonts

Capture both English and Hindi variants wherever available. Ensure Hindi PDFs/ePubs embed appropriate fonts and verify readability across devices. Record language tags, and if subtitles are present for videos, capture and store them alongside the media file. CIET and PM eVidya materials provide guidance and context for bilingual content use and access.[^3][^6]


## Organization & Metadata (How to Structure for Reuse)

Organize content into stable collections and series. Collections group items by topic family and subtopic; series capture multi-part sequences (e.g., “Coding–Decoding: Basics → Intermediate → Advanced”). Cross-link related items (e.g., a concept note and its associated practice quiz). Maintain a crosswalk to RRB NTPC topic labels to keep the repository aligned with exam syllabi.

### Content Types vs Recommended Fields

| Content Type | Required Fields | Optional Fields |
|---|---|---|
| PDF | title, topic_family, subtopic, language, cbt_flag, source_platform, file_type, description, tags, checksum | grade_level, rights, source_url |
| Video | title, topic_family, subtopic, language, cbt_flag, source_platform, description, tags, checksum | subtitles, duration |
| H5P | title, topic_family, subtopic, language, cbt_flag, source_platform, file_type, description, tags, checksum | compatibility notes |
| ePub | title, topic_family, subtopic, language, cbt_flag, source_platform, file_type, description, tags, checksum | font notes |
| Quiz | title, topic_family, subtopic, language, cbt_flag, source_platform, file_type, description, tags, checksum | item_count |

### Tagging Taxonomy: Topic → Subtopic → CBT1/CBT2 → Language → Source

| Dimension | Values (Examples) | Usage |
|---|---|---|
| topic | logical_reasoning, verbal_reasoning, non_verbal_reasoning, mental_ability | Primary grouping |
| subtopic | coding_decoding, blood_relations, direction_sense, analogies, figure_series | Secondary grouping |
| cbt | CBT 1, CBT 2, CBT 1 + CBT 2 | Exam-stage tagging |
| language | english, hindi, bilingual | Language capture |
| source | diksha, public | Platform provenance |

#### Search & Retrieve

Use local full-text indexing to enable queries by topic, subtopic, stage (CBT 1/CBT 2), language, and source. Maintain alias maps for synonyms (e.g., “alphabet test” ↔ “alphabetical test”) to improve retrieval. This supports rapid assembly of study plans and practice sets.


## Platform Navigation, Content Availability, and Download Processes (Evidence & Documentation)

Discovery on DIKSHA is contingent on login. Observed behaviors include redirecting search to authentication pages and limiting guest access. Documentation should include login methods, filters, and state-level repositories. When direct DIKSHA content is unavailable or constrained, verified public repositories and open-access PDFs provide structured coverage.[^1][^44]

![Observed DIKSHA state indicating login requirement](/workspace/browser/screenshots/final_diksha_state.png)

### DIKSHA Access & Actions Matrix (Authentication → Feature → Notes)

| Authentication | Feature | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Post-login | Search | Requires query patterns and filters |
| Post-login | Dashboard | Personalized recommendations and collections |
| Post-login | Explore As | Role-based content visibility |
| Post-login | Download | Preserves formats; metadata capture required |

### Public Alternatives Coverage (Source → Topic → Format → Capture Path)

| Source | Topic | Format | Capture Path |
|---|---|---|---|
| PMTutor | Verbal reasoning | PDF | fallback/public/verbal_reasoning/ |
| Handbook of Verbal Reasoning | Coding–Decoding, Blood Relations | PDF | fallback/public/verbal_reasoning/coding_decoding/ |

#### Karnataka DSERT Example (State-Level DIKSHA Ecosystem)

State repositories demonstrate how e-resources are created, mapped to state curricula, and uploaded to DIKSHA. Documenting state-level pathways helps locate bilingual materials aligned to local syllabi and provides context for content provenance.[^45]


## Quality Assurance & Validation (So What: Fitness for Purpose)

Quality assurance ensures materials are accurate, complete, aligned, and usable. Validation includes verifying RRB NTPC topic mapping, bilingual integrity, readability, and metadata completeness. Where possible, perform spot checks on solutions and tag items with confidence scores.

### Validation Checklist (Pass/Fail/NA per Criterion)

| Criterion | Pass | Fail | NA | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Topic alignment (RRB NTPC) |  |  |  | Verified against consolidated syllabus |
| Language fidelity (EN/HI) |  |  |  | Verify bilingual pairs and fonts |
| Completeness (content vs description) |  |  |  | All parts present (e.g., answer keys) |
| Readability (PDF/ePub fonts) |  |  |  | Hindi rendering checked |
| Metadata completeness |  |  |  | Required fields present |
| Format preservation |  |  |  | Original extensions intact |
| Accessibility (alt text for images) |  |  |  | Where applicable |
| Interactivity (H5P) |  |  |  | Package complete and functional |
| Integrity (checksum) |  |  |  | File hash recorded |
| Provenance (source captured) |  |  |  | URL and platform recorded |

### Issue Types → Severity → Resolution Steps

| Issue | Severity | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Off-topic content | High | Exclude; annotate reason; seek replacement |
| Missing Hindi variant | Medium | Search again with language filter; if absent, note gap |
| Corrupted file | High | Re-download; verify checksum |
| Poor image quality | Medium | Seek alternative source or higher-resolution version |
| Incomplete package (H5P) | High | Re-export; verify dependencies |
| Metadata missing | Medium | Complete required fields before archiving |
| Font rendering issues (Hindi) | Medium | Re-package with embedded fonts; test |
| Broken link (fallback) | Medium | Replace with mirror; update metadata |

#### Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance requires full topic alignment to RRB NTPC Reasoning, bilingual availability where declared, verifiable metadata, integrity checksums, and pass on spot checks for solutions. Only items meeting these criteria should be archived for production use.


## Logging Plan: /logs/diksha-reasoning.log

Logging captures end-to-end traceability, errors, and decision points. Each run should produce an append-only log with timestamps (ISO 8601), query strings, filters applied, results summaries, download successes/failures, retries, fallback notes, and curator initials.

### Log Fields & Examples

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| timestamp | 2025-10-30T20:21:46Z |
| action | search |
| query | “verbal reasoning” AND “coding–decoding” |
| filters | language=hi, role=teacher, state=KA |
| results_summary | “12 items; 10 PDFs, 2 videos; 8 bilingual” |
| download_status | “success: 11; fail: 1 (H5P incomplete)” |
| retries | “H5P package re-exported; retry success” |
| fallback_note | “MathCentre used for non-verbal series due to access block” |
| curator | “RRB_OER_Curator_01” |

Errors should be captured with context and remediation steps. Failed downloads must include reason codes and follow a retry policy (e.g., two retries with exponential backoff). Auth issues require noting the authentication method used and any constraints observed.

#### Example Log Excerpt Template

- 2025-10-30T20:21:46Z | search | query=logical reasoning AND data sufficiency | filters=language=en, role=teacher | results_summary=8 PDFs, 4 quizzes | download_status=success: 11; fail: 1 (video timeout) | retries=video re-download success | fallback_note=none | curator=RRB_OER_Curator_01

- 2025-10-30T20:35:12Z | download | item=non_verbal_figure-series_english_public_20251030.pdf | status=fail (403) | fallback=MathCentre | retry=success | curator=RRB_OER_Curator_02


## Risks, Constraints & Mitigation

DIKSHA’s authentication requirements and occasional CDN blocking can restrict public discovery and access. These risks are mitigated through systematic authentication, role-based exploration, structured fallback sources, and meticulous logging.

### Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Authentication barriers | High | High | Obtain account; document steps; use SSO | Curator | Open |
| CDN blocking (403) | Medium | Medium | Retry; use alternate mirror; log incident | Curator | Open |
| License/terms uncertainty | Medium | Medium | Verify license; restrict use to educational purposes | Curator | Open |
| Content stability (links changing) | Medium | Medium | Regular audits; checksum verification | Curator | Open |
| Hindi font rendering issues | Medium | Low | Embed fonts; test across devices | Curator | Open |
| Incomplete bilingual capture | Medium | Medium | Language filters; targeted searches | Curator | Open |
| H5P dependency breakage | Low | High | Package dependencies; test locally | Curator | Open |
| Inconsistent metadata | Medium | Medium | Enforce schema; QA checklist | Curator | Open |
| Timeouts on large files | Medium | Medium | Segment downloads; schedule off-peak | Curator | Open |

UNESCO’s analysis of DIKSHA underscores platform strengths and scale, which supports the feasibility of content discovery once authentication is addressed.[^16] Official notices and press releases further contextualize DIKSHA’s role and coverage within national digital education initiatives.[^17]

## Acknowledged Information Gaps

- Direct DIKSHA content discovery requires login; without authenticated access, verified bilingual Reasoning content links are limited.
- DIKSHA-specific export APIs or bulk-download documentation was not available in the provided context.
- Fallback sources may not explicitly label content as “DIKSHA”; alignment is via topic relevance rather than platform provenance.
- License and redistribution terms for all collected content must be verified at capture time.

These gaps are explicitly mitigated by the authentication-first workflow, language filters, structured fallback catalog, and QA processes defined in this guide.

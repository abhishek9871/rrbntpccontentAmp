# DIKSHA Platform Collection Blueprint for RRB NTPC General Intelligence & Reasoning

## Executive Overview & Objectives

This blueprint establishes a practical, evidence-backed approach to discover, validate, download, and organize General Intelligence & Reasoning materials from the DIKSHA platform that precisely align with the RRB NTPC syllabus for both Computer-Based Tests (CBT 1 and CBT 2). The target outcome is a ready-to-use, bilingual (English/Hindi) study materials repository, preserved in original formats, discoverable through clear metadata, and structured for efficient retrieval and reuse.

DIKSHA—India’s national digital platform for school education—hosts an extensive repository of curriculum-aligned content across multiple languages and formats, enabling role-based exploration for teachers, students, and parents. The platform’s official positioning under PM eVidya, and its documented breadth of language support and content formats, make it the primary national source for open educational resources (OER) relevant to RRB NTPC Reasoning preparation, provided navigation and authentication are correctly implemented.[^1][^3][^6]

The blueprint’s scope includes:
- Logical Reasoning (e.g., analytical reasoning, syllogism, data sufficiency, statement–conclusion, decision making, jumbling, Venn diagrams, maps, interpretation of graphs).
- Verbal Reasoning (series, analogies, classification, coding–decoding, direction sense, blood relations, alphabet test, mathematical operations, similarities and differences).
- Non-Verbal Reasoning (figure series, analogies, classification).
- Mental Ability (pattern recognition, visualization, applied logic and problem-solving).

These categories map directly to the RRB NTPC General Intelligence & Reasoning section, whose architecture and topic prescriptions are stable across recent cycles and corroborated by official syllabi and leading exam-pattern portals.[^25][^27][^28][^29]

Constraints and assumptions:
- DIKSHA requires login for search and download; public browsing is limited.[^1]
- Content availability varies by state, board, and medium; bilingual (Hindi/English) variants must be captured where present.
- Original formats (PDF, video, HTML, ePub, H5P, quizzes) should be preserved; metadata must be bilingual.
- Verification relies on official DIKSHA portals and credible exam-prep sources; downloads must include source attribution, license notes, and checksums.

Narrative arc:
- What: A stable RRB NTPC Reasoning syllabus and topic taxonomy.
- How: A DIKSHA-first strategy leveraging authentication, language and role filters, bilingual capture, and a structured metadata schema; supported by vetted fallback repositories when DIKSHA access is blocked.
- So What: A fully traceable, bilingual OER repository, with a quality assurance (QA) framework, a comprehensive log, and a risk mitigation plan to ensure continuity and integrity.

To situate the platform’s scope within national education initiatives, the following visual highlights DIKSHA’s role and reach.

![DIKSHA: National platform scope (PM eVidya context)](/workspace/browser/screenshots/diksha_homepage.png)

The scope is ambitious yet pragmatic: achieve full syllabus alignment, preserve original formats, and ensure long-term usability through disciplined curation and QA—while acknowledging the platform’s authentication prerequisites and potential access barriers.[^3][^6]


## RRB NTPC Reasoning Syllabus Mapping (What to Collect)

RRB NTPC assesses General Intelligence & Reasoning through a consistent structure across CBT 1 and CBT 2. The topic families remain stable and are explicitly listed in consolidated syllabi. Verified sources converge on the following taxonomy:

- Logical Reasoning: data sufficiency; statement–conclusion; syllogism; decision making; puzzle; jumbling; Venn diagrams; maps; interpretation of graphs.
- Verbal Reasoning: series (number, alphabet, alphanumeric); analogies; classification; coding–decoding; direction sense; blood relations; alphabet test; mathematical operations; similarities and differences.
- Non-Verbal Reasoning: figure series; figure analogies; figure classification.
- Mental Ability: pattern recognition; visualization; applied logic and problem-solving.

Sources corroborate continuity in section weightages and the presence of these topics across CBT 1 and CBT 2, with CBT 2 sometimes emphasizing applied and multi-step reasoning.[^25][^27][^28][^29]

To translate this into a concrete collection plan, the following table presents a topic-to-subtopic mapping with CBT 1/2 coverage flags.

### Topic-to-Subtopic Mapping with CBT 1/CBT 2 Coverage Flags

| Topic Family | Subtopics | CBT 1 | CBT 2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Logical Reasoning | Data sufficiency; statement–conclusion; syllogism; decision making; puzzle; jumbling; Venn diagrams; maps; interpretation of graphs | Yes | Yes |
| Verbal Reasoning | Number/alphabet/alphanumeric series; analogies; classification; coding–decoding; direction sense; blood relations; alphabet test; mathematical operations; similarities & differences | Yes | Yes |
| Non-Verbal Reasoning | Figure series; figure analogies; figure classification | Yes | Yes |
| Mental Ability | Pattern recognition; visualization; applied logic and problem-solving | Yes | Yes |

These flags reflect topic continuity across stages and align to official and portal-consensus enumerations.[^25][^27][^28][^29]

### RRB NTPC Reasoning Topics → DIKSHA Search Queries → Content Types → Priority

To operationalize collection, the following table translates topics into actionable search blueprints, expected content types, and relative priorities for capture.

Priority reflects the prevalence and weight of these topics in RRB NTPC and their centrality in the Reasoning section, as corroborated by consolidated syllabi and exam-pattern summaries.[^25][^27][^28][^29]


## DIKSHA Platform Profile & Access (How to Navigate)

DIKSHA is the national digital infrastructure for school education, integrating content across states and curricula with broad language support and multi-format delivery (PDF, video, H5P, ePub, quizzes). Role-based access enables teachers, students, and parents to explore tailored materials, while state-level implementations leverage the platform for teacher development and e-content curation.[^2][^3][^4][^6][^18][^45]

A key operational reality is authentication: core discovery and download functions require login. Public search is limited, and unauthenticated browsing rarely surfaces the depth and specificity needed for targeted collection. Accordingly, the following navigation flow is recommended:

- Register via available identity options (e.g., Google SSO, state system SSO, email/mobile).
- Use the dashboard for personalized recommendations and recent activity.
- Employ “Explore As” to adjust content views by role (e.g., teacher vs student).
- Apply language filters (English/Hindi), and medium/state filters for board alignment.
- Use structured search queries built from topic families (see Search Strategy).

![DIKSHA experience portal page observed during exploration](/workspace/browser/screenshots/diksha_experience_portal.png)

![Observed DIKSHA state indicating login requirement](/workspace/browser/screenshots/final_diksha_state.png)

These observations underscore the need to document authentication steps, filters, and state repositories in a platform_use.md file within the repository. CIET and PM eVidya documentation further detail access modalities and language coverage.[^3][^6]

### Authentication Pathways vs Capabilities

| Method | Search | Download | Language Toggle | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Google SSO | Yes | Yes | Yes | Fast setup; ensure profile completeness |
| State System SSO | Yes | Yes | Yes | Useful for state-curriculum-aligned content |
| Email/Mobile Registration | Yes | Yes | Yes | Requires verification; flexible |
| MeriPehchaan (OTP) | Yes (limited) | Yes (limited) | Yes | Good for student-focused exploration |

### Content Types vs Download Workflow

| Content Type | Extension | Bilingual Workflow | Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| PDF | .pdf | Filter language; capture EN/HI pairs | Download and checksum |
| Video | .mp4/streaming | Metadata language; subtitles if present | Record and preserve subtitles |
| H5P | .html package | Language tag; test interactivity | Export and verify dependencies |
| ePub | .epub | Verify font rendering (Hindi) | Download, embed fonts if needed |
| Quiz | JSON/HTML | Capture items and answers | Store item bank and metadata |

#### Roles, Explore As, and Filters

Role-based exploration changes visible content and recommendations. Language filters ensure bilingual capture, while medium and state filters align resources with curricular contexts. In practice, topic-based queries coupled with role and language filters produce the most relevant practice sets and concept notes.[^1]


## Search Strategy & Collection Workflow (How to Execute)

Execution begins with authenticated search using query blueprints derived from RRB NTPC topic families. Each query should specify the topic and variant (e.g., “coding–decoding,” “figure series”), combined with language filters and grade-level constraints (e.g., classes 6–10). Document each search string, pagination behavior, filters applied, and the resulting artifacts.

Where DIKSHA access is blocked or insufficiently public, vetted fallback repositories provide high-quality coverage. These include public PDFs (handbooks, practice tests, sample papers) covering verbal, non-verbal, and mental ability topics. Each fallback must be aligned to RRB NTPC topics and stored under a dedicated “fallback/public” segment with provenance and license notes in metadata.[^32][^33][^35][^36][^40][^41][^42][^43][^49][^50]

![Post-login exploration context for targeted collection](/workspace/browser/screenshots/diksha_experience_portal.png)

### Search String Patterns per Topic Family

| Topic Family | Query Pattern | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Logical Reasoning | “logical reasoning” AND “data sufficiency” OR “statement conclusion” OR “syllogism” | Use role and grade filters |
| Verbal Reasoning | “verbal reasoning” AND series/analogies/classification/coding–decoding/blood/direction | Apply language filter |
| Non-Verbal Reasoning | “non verbal” AND “figure series” OR “analogy” OR “classification” | Capture image-heavy sets |
| Mental Ability | “mental ability” AND “pattern” OR “visualization” | Prioritize mixed practice sets |

### Fallback Public Sources Mapping

| Topic | Source | Format | License | Capture Path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Verbal analogies/classification | PMTutor Verbal Reasoning | PDF | Verify terms | fallback/public/verbal_reasoning/analogies/ |
| Coding–Decoding/Blood Relations | Handbook of Verbal Reasoning | PDF | Verify terms | fallback/public/verbal_reasoning/coding_decoding/ |
| Direction Sense | Meritnotes | PDF/Web | Verify terms | fallback/public/verbal_reasoning/direction_sense/ |
| Non-Verbal series/analogies/classification | MathCentre | PDF | Academic use | fallback/public/non_verbal_reasoning/series/ |
| Non-Verbal concepts | Testbook (PDF) | PDF | Verify terms | fallback/public/non_verbal_reasoning/concepts/ |
| Mental Ability (series, figures) | Class 10 Mental Ability (Tekoclasses) | PDF | Verify terms | fallback/public/mental_ability/series/ |
| NTSE MAT Sample | NTSE Sample Paper | PDF | Academic use | fallback/public/mental_ability/mat_sample/ |
| Logical Reasoning (comprehensive) | Upkar’s Logical Reasoning & Analytical Ability | PDF | Verify terms | fallback/public/logical_reasoning/book/ |

#### Bilingual Capture & Font Handling

Bilingual capture involves:
- Recording language tags (English, Hindi, bilingual).
- Preserving Hindi fonts in PDFs/ePubs; ensure consistent rendering across devices.
- Capturing subtitles and language descriptions for videos and interactive content.
CIET and PM eVidya materials note DIKSHA’s multi-language support and accessibility considerations; these guidelines should inform bilingual workflows and metadata practices.[^3][^6]


## Directory Structure, Naming, and Metadata (How to Organize)

A robust directory schema, clear naming conventions, and comprehensive metadata ensure long-term usability, traceability, and deduplication. The repository root for RRB NTPC OER Reasoning is:

/content/rrb-ntpc/study-materials/oer/reasoning/

### Directory Schema with Examples

| Level | Element | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Root | RRB NTPC OER root | /content/rrb-ntpc/study-materials/oer/reasoning/ |
| Topic Family | logical_reasoning, verbal_reasoning, non_verbal_reasoning, mental_ability | /content/.../logical_reasoning/ |
| Subtopic | e.g., coding_decoding, blood_relations, direction_sense, analogies, figure_series | /content/.../verbal_reasoning/coding_decoding/ |
| Language | english, hindi, bilingual | /content/.../coding_decoding/hindi/ |
| Source | diksha, fallback/public | /content/.../coding_decoding/hindi/diksha/ |
| Artifact | filename with extension | lesson_plan_coding_decoding_hi.pdf |

### Metadata Schema Table

| Field | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| title | Original content title | “Direction Sense Practice Set (Hindi)” |
| topic_family | logical_reasoning, verbal_reasoning, non_verbal_reasoning, mental_ability | verbal_reasoning |
| subtopic | Specific subtopic | direction_sense |
| language | english, hindi, bilingual | hindi |
| cbt_flag | CBT 1, CBT 2, CBT 1 + CBT 2 | CBT 1 + CBT 2 |
| source_platform | diksha or fallback/public | diksha |
| source_url | Originating URL (recorded in metadata) | (recorded in metadata JSON) |
| file_type | pdf, video, h5p, epub, quiz | pdf |
| grade_level | Suggested grade/level | Class 8–10 |
| subject | Reasoning | Reasoning |
| rights | License or usage note | As per DIKSHA terms |
| description | Short abstract | “Practice problems on directional moves with solutions.” |
| tags | Comma-separated keywords | direction, sense, verbal, practice |
| checksum | File hash for integrity | SHA-256: … |
| collected_by | Curator identifier | “OER_Curator_01” |
| collected_on | ISO date | 2025-10-30 |

#### Naming Conventions

Use descriptive, consistent names with minimal ambiguity. Avoid spaces; prefer hyphens and underscores as needed.

### Pattern Examples and Allowed Characters

| Pattern | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| {topic}_{subtopic}_{language}_{grade}_{source}_{YYYYMMDD}.{ext} | verbal_coding-decoding_hindi_class8-10_diksha_20251030.pdf | Hyphens allowed; maintain uniqueness |
| {topic}_{subtopic}_{language}_{source}_{YYYYMMDD}.{ext} | non_verbal_figure-series_english_public_20251030.pdf | Use “public” for fallbacks |
| {topic}_{subtopic}_{language}_{source}_{artifactId}.{ext} | logical_data-sufficiency_bilingual_diksha_h5p_20251030.zip | For interactive packages |

Deduplication relies on checksums and normalized titles; cross-references link related artifacts (e.g., a concept note with its practice quiz).


## Download & Preservation Workflow (How to Deliver)

Deliverables include PDFs, H5P packages, videos, ePubs, and quizzes—each preserved in original format with metadata. Downloads occur post-authentication; language variants (English/Hindi) must be captured and stored as pairs when available. For each artifact, record provenance (source URL, platform), language, file type, grade level, and topic alignment.

### Content Type vs Preservation Method vs Metadata Requirements

| Content Type | Preservation Method | Metadata Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| PDF | Store with embedded fonts; compute checksum | title, topic_family, subtopic, language, cbt_flag, source_platform, file_type, rights, description, tags, checksum, collected_by, collected_on |
| Video | Preserve subtitle files if present; record language metadata | title, topic_family, subtopic, language, cbt_flag, source_platform, description, tags, checksum, collected_by, collected_on |
| H5P | Export package; ensure dependencies; test locally | title, topic_family, subtopic, language, cbt_flag, source_platform, file_type, description, tags, checksum, collected_by, collected_on |
| ePub | Embed fonts; test readability | title, topic_family, subtopic, language, cbt_flag, source_platform, file_type, rights, description, tags, checksum, collected_by, collected_on |
| Quiz | Store item bank and answer keys | title, topic_family, subtopic, language, cbt_flag, source_platform, file_type, description, tags, checksum, collected_by, collected_on |

![Access-gated download flow necessitates authenticated workflows](/workspace/browser/screenshots/final_diksha_state.png)

#### Integrity & Versioning

Assign version identifiers per artifact and maintain a changelog. Checksums (e.g., SHA-256) verify integrity. Any remakes (e.g., font embedding for Hindi PDFs) must be documented in metadata and changelog, preserving the original file as “source” and the remade file as “derived.”


## Quality Assurance & Validation (So What: Fitness for Purpose)

Quality assurance ensures that collected materials are accurate, aligned, bilingual, readable, and traceable. Validation checks confirm topic alignment to RRB NTPC, language fidelity, completeness (e.g., answer keys), readability (especially Hindi fonts), metadata completeness, format preservation, accessibility (alt text for images, where applicable), interactivity (H5P), integrity (checksums), and provenance (source captured).

### Validation Checklist (Pass/Fail/NA per Criterion)

| Criterion | Pass | Fail | NA | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Topic alignment (RRB NTPC) |  |  |  | Cross-checked against consolidated syllabi |
| Language fidelity (EN/HI) |  |  |  | Bilingual variants captured where available |
| Completeness (content vs description) |  |  |  | Answer keys and instructions included |
| Readability (PDF/ePub fonts) |  |  |  | Hindi rendering tested |
| Metadata completeness |  |  |  | Required fields present |
| Format preservation |  |  |  | Original formats retained |
| Accessibility (alt text for images) |  |  |  | Where applicable |
| Interactivity (H5P) |  |  |  | Dependencies verified |
| Integrity (checksum) |  |  |  | Hash recorded |
| Provenance (source captured) |  |  |  | URL and platform recorded |

### Issue Types → Severity → Resolution Steps

| Issue | Severity | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Off-topic content | High | Exclude; document rationale; seek replacement |
| Missing Hindi variant | Medium | Re-run bilingual search; annotate gap |
| Corrupted file | High | Re-download; verify checksum; if persistent, source alternative |
| Poor image quality (non-verbal) | Medium | Seek higher-resolution source |
| Incomplete H5P package | High | Re-export; verify interactions |
| Metadata missing | Medium | Backfill required fields |
| Font rendering issues (Hindi) | Medium | Re-package with embedded fonts; document change |
| Broken fallback links | Medium | Replace with mirror; update metadata |
| Timeout on large downloads | Medium | Retry; schedule during off-peak; segment if needed |

#### Acceptance Criteria

Items must pass all required QA checks, demonstrate explicit alignment to RRB NTPC Reasoning topics, show bilingual coverage where declared, and include complete metadata with integrity checksums. Only items meeting these criteria are accepted into the repository for production use.

QA criteria are derived from consolidated RRB NTPC syllabi and exam-pattern portals, and from DIKSHA’s content-format capabilities.[^25][^26][^27]


## Logging Plan (/logs/diksha-reasoning.log)

Logging is essential for traceability and audit. The repository must maintain an append-only log, /logs/diksha-reasoning.log, capturing timestamps, action types, queries, filters, results summaries, download status, retries, fallback notes, and curator identifiers.

### Log Fields & Examples

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| timestamp | 2025-10-30T20:21:46Z |
| action | search |
| query | “verbal reasoning” AND “direction sense” |
| filters | language=hi, role=teacher |
| results_summary | “10 items; 7 PDFs, 3 videos; 5 bilingual” |
| download_status | “success: 9; fail: 1 (PDF corrupted)” |
| retries | “retry success after re-download” |
| fallback_note | “MathCentre used for non-verbal series due to access block” |
| curator | “OER_Curator_01” |

#### Example Log Excerpt Template

- 2025-10-30T20:21:46Z | search | query=logical reasoning AND data sufficiency | filters=language=en, role=teacher | results_summary=8 PDFs, 4 quizzes | download_status=success: 11; fail: 1 (video timeout) | retries=success on retry | fallback_note=none | curator=OER_Curator_01

- 2025-10-30T20:35:12Z | download | item=non_verbal_figure-series_english_public_20251030.pdf | status=fail (403) | fallback=MathCentre | retry=success | curator=OER_Curator_02

Audits rely on these entries; queries, filters, and outcomes must be reproducible and clearly documented.

## Acknowledged Information Gaps

- DIKSHA’s authenticated access constrains public discovery and verification of downloadable Reasoning content; queries and filters require login.
- Publicly accessible, verified DIKSHA-hosted bilingual Reasoning links are limited; bilingual capture relies on platform access and state-board repositories.
- DIKSHA export APIs or bulk-download tooling are not present in the provided context; workflows focus on authenticated UI workflows and verified public fallbacks.

This blueprint mitigates these gaps via a login-first approach, systematic search and filter strategies, and a vetted fallback catalog to ensure continuous coverage.

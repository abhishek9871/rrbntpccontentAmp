# Comprehensive Audit Summary of Collected Content Across All Phases

## Executive Summary

This audit consolidates and analyzes the content corpus assembled across multiple phases of the RRB NTPC and DIKSHA-related research and collection efforts. The corpus spans exam preparation materials, open educational resources (OER), general awareness content, reasoning and mathematics practice sets, current affairs compilations, and operational artifacts (e.g., logs, downloads, and browser-extracted content). The audit’s scope includes quantifying inventory, characterizing formats and languages, assessing credibility, reviewing licensing status, and identifying gaps in coverage.

Key outcomes are as follows. The corpus contains 569 files totaling approximately 2.32 GB. By format, JSON (218), PDF (130), and HTML (128) dominate; Markdown (43) and Code (17) comprise a smaller share. Most files fall in the 1 KB–1 MB range (403), with 81 large assets (1 MB–100 MB) and one very large asset exceeding 100 MB; 84 files are smaller than 1 KB. The majority of materials reside under the primary RRB NTPC content directory (226), with sizable bodies also found in browser-extracted content (111), DIKSHA GA (52), DIKSHA Math (46), DIKSHA Science (34), DIKSHA Reasoning (14), downloads (26), extract (25), docs (14), logs (7), and licensing (2). Language detection is incomplete—most items are marked “Mixed/Unknown”—and needs structured metadata expansion for language fidelity. Credibility classification yields three levels (High, Medium, Unknown) yet is not uniformly applied across all items and therefore warrants a second pass to strengthen consistency and traceability to sources.

Coverage is broad but uneven. General Awareness, Mathematics, Reasoning, and Science collections are present. DIKSHA GA houses economy, geography, Indian history, polity, and science-technology subtopics, along with static general knowledge. Current affairs are organized by year (2020–2024) across categories such as annual reports, economic surveys, ministry publications, policy documents, and yearbooks. RRB NTPC subfolders cover current affairs (2024, 2025), language-specific directories (English, Hindi), practice sets, previous papers (CBT1 and CBT2), and study materials (OER and Wikimedia). Identified gaps include systematic syllabus-level mapping, bilingual alignment for Hindi and English materials, and a more complete temporal range for current affairs and previous papers.

Top recommendations focus on completing metadata (particularly language tags), formalizing credibility labels and source mapping, expanding bilingual coverage aligned to the syllabus, enforcing licensing compliance with attribution templates, automating quality checks (duplicate detection via hashing, completeness checks, metadata validation), and establishing continuous auditing procedures. Immediate next steps include categorizing all “Mixed/Unknown” languages into standardized tags (en, hi, multi), verifying licensing files for all DIKSHA content, and integrating per-file metadata (hash, size, timestamp, source, license) into the content inventory JSON for reliable downstream use.

## Audit Scope, Methodology, and Data Sources

The audit scope encompasses all directories and file types assembled during the content collection phases. The following areas were in scope: RRB NTPC content, DIKSHA GA (General Awareness), DIKSHA Mathematics, DIKSHA Reasoning, DIKSHA Science, Current Affairs by year and category, browser-extracted content (including screenshots), downloads and practice materials, documentation and logs, and licensing artifacts.

Methodologically, the audit proceeded by scanning directories and aggregating counts by format, size bucket, and location. Content categories were mapped to the top-level structure visible across folders, including DIKSHA subtopics and RRB NTPC subfolders. Aggregations were performed using file-level attributes: format categories derived from file extensions, size buckets based on computed sizes, and credibility classifications inferred from provenance and observable indicators. Language detection was noted as incomplete, with the majority tagged as “Mixed/Unknown.”

To illustrate coverage, Table 1 summarizes the directories scanned and the number of files discovered. The majority sits within the RRB NTPC content directory and browser-extracted content, with meaningful contributions from DIKSHA subject streams.

### Data Lineage and Timestamps

File-level attributes were recorded, including a SHA-256 hash, size, and last-modified timestamps. These attributes enable deduplication, change tracking, and quality checks, and should be propagated into the content inventory JSON for programmatic consumption.

The screenshot above exemplifies the provenance records maintained for browser-extracted content. Capturing these artifacts provides a chain of custody for derived materials and supports reproducibility. It also creates a reference point for tracing content origins, especially when mappings to original sources are needed for credibility and licensing.

## Inventory Overview and Storage Summary

The consolidated inventory comprises 569 files consuming approximately 2.32 GB. By format, JSON (218), PDF (130), and HTML (128) constitute the core, reflecting a mix of structured data extracts, primary documents (e.g., exam syllabi, reference materials), and captured web content. Markdown (43) and Code (17) are present for documentation and tooling, while Archives (4), Text (2), and CSV (2) are limited. Size distribution shows most assets are medium-sized (1 KB–1 MB), with a long tail of large files and a single very large file (>100 MB).

### Table 2. File Format Distribution

| Format               | Count |
|---------------------|-------|
| JSON Data           | 218   |
| PDF Document        | 130   |
| HTML Page           | 128   |
| Markdown Document   | 43    |
| Code                | 17    |
| Other               | 25    |
| Archive             | 4     |
| Text Document       | 2     |
| CSV Data            | 2     |

The prevalence of JSON and HTML underscores the proportion of structured extracts and captured pages, while PDFs reflect core reference documents and practice materials. This mix is conducive to both machine processing and human study, though it places a premium on consistent metadata for discoverability.

### Table 3. Storage Usage by Content Location

| Location            | Files |
|---------------------|-------|
| content (RRB NTPC)  | 226   |
| browser             | 111   |
| diksha-ga           | 52    |
| diksha-math         | 46    |
| diksha-science      | 34    |
| downloads           | 26    |
| extract             | 25    |
| docs                | 14    |
| current-affairs     | 12    |
| diksha-reasoning    | 14    |
| logs                | 7     |
| licensing           | 2     |

The distribution indicates a robust base of RRB NTPC materials and significant contributions from browser-based extraction and DIKSHA subject streams. Operational artifacts (logs, docs) are appropriately lightweight relative to primary content.

### Table 4. Size Bucket Summary

| Size Bucket                | Count |
|---------------------------|-------|
| Small (<1 KB)             | 84    |
| Medium (1 KB–1 MB)        | 403   |
| Large (1 MB–100 MB)       | 81    |
| Very Large (>100 MB)      | 1     |

The concentration in the medium range suggests generally compact assets suitable for efficient storage and transfer. The presence of 81 large files and one very large asset warrants periodic benchmarking for performance and targeted optimization (e.g., compression, segmentation) where acceptable.

### Per-Location Breakdown

Location-specific notes provide contextual guidance for targeted remediation and quality control. Table 5 consolidates these observations and flags initial quality signals per location.

The evidence screenshot above demonstrates how web-captured artifacts were preserved to document provenance and content structure. These artifacts serve as the backbone for traceability and are essential for credibility assessment and licensing checks.

## Subject Coverage and Curriculum Alignment

Coverage spans General Awareness, Mathematics, Reasoning, Science, and Current Affairs. DIKSHA GA contains economy, geography, Indian history (ancient, medieval, modern), polity (constitution, governance, institutions), science-technology, and static general knowledge (books-authors, important dates, organizations). DIKSHA Math and DIKSHA Reasoning include structured practice materials and metadata. Science content reflects both textual and bilingual resources. Current affairs materials are organized by year (2020–2024) and category (annual reports, economic surveys, ministry publications, policy documents, yearbooks), and the RRB NTPC directory includes current affairs for 2024 and 2025.

The depth and breadth vary by domain. General Awareness appears broad, while Mathematics and Reasoning are present but would benefit from uniform metadata tags to aid alignment with specific syllabus sections. Science content shows bilingual distribution but lacks consistent per-asset language tagging. The RRB NTPC directory organizes previous papers by CBT1 and CBT2 and study materials under OER and Wikimedia, but standardized curriculum mapping remains incomplete.

### Table 6. Subject Coverage Summary (Counts by High-Level Category)

| High-Level Category | Representative Directories             | Observed Coverage | Notes                                            |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| General Awareness   | diksha-ga, current-affairs, static-gk  | Present           | Multiple subtopics; broad but uneven depth       |
| Mathematics         | diksha-math                            | Present           | Practice sets and metadata; format variety       |
| Reasoning           | diksha-reasoning                       | Present           | Logical/verbal/non-verbal domains                |
| Science             | diksha-science                         | Present           | Bilingual artifacts; metadata partial            |
| Current Affairs     | current-affairs (2020–2024)            | Present           | Yearly organization; coverage differs by year    |
| RRB NTPC Materials  | content/rrb-ntpc                       | Present           | Language dirs, practice sets, previous papers    |

![Sample evidence of General Awareness materials during exploration.](/workspace/browser/screenshots/biodiversity_correct_page.png)

This screenshot reflects the type of educational content captured within GA collections and underscores the diversity of sources and presentation formats, ranging from static GK compendia to topical explorations. Standardizing metadata at the asset level will enable more precise curriculum alignment and facilitate comparative analyses across subjects.

#### Identified Gaps

Several gaps emerged:

- Lack of explicit, per-file mapping to standardized exam syllabi at topic and subtopic levels.  
- Inconsistent bilingual alignment; while language directories exist, asset-level language tags are incomplete.  
- Current affairs coverage appears stronger for 2020–2024 but appears sparse for 2025, suggesting a temporal gap.  
- Previous papers may not uniformly span all CBT1/CBT2 cycles; an itemized list per year/exam is recommended.

## Language Distribution and Localization

Language detection is incomplete; the majority of items are tagged as “Mixed/Unknown.” Within the RRB NTPC corpus, language subdirectories exist for English and Hindi. DIKSHA Science includes bilingual artifacts, indicating the presence of both English and Hindi materials in certain subjects. However, the inconsistency of asset-level language tagging across locations complicates bilingual coverage assessment and curriculum alignment.

### Table 7. Language Tagging Status (Aggregate Counts)

| Language Tag       | Count | Notes                                            |
|--------------------|-------|--------------------------------------------------|
| en                 | Not computed | Present via subdirs; asset-level tagging incomplete |
| hi                 | Not computed | Present via subdirs; asset-level tagging incomplete |
| Mixed/Unknown      | Majority     | Requires systematic re-tagging                  |
| Other/Unspecified  | Not computed | Needs standardization                           |

To strengthen localization and accessibility, we recommend implementing a deterministic language tagging policy. Each asset should carry an explicit language tag (en, hi, multi) derived from file path signals, embedded metadata, and content inspection where necessary.

### Table 8. Bilingual Coverage Audit Plan

| Subject Area       | Action                                      | Expected Outcome                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| General Awareness  | Tag all assets to en/hi/multi               | Clear bilingual coverage map               |
| Mathematics        | Validate metadata; re-tag assets            | Consistent language distribution           |
| Reasoning          | Tag assets; align with practice sets        | Bilingual accessibility                    |
| Science            | Normalize language tags across PDFs/ZIPs    | Uniform bilingual inventory                |
| Current Affairs    | Tag by document language and year           | Temporal-bilingual alignment               |
| RRB NTPC Materials | Audit language dirs; add per-asset tags     | Reliable bilingual alignment to syllabus   |

## Source Credibility Assessment

Credibility levels were assigned at the asset level based on observed indicators: High (e.g., government, official), Medium (e.g., recognized educational platforms), and Unknown (e.g., non-verified or indirect provenance). The corpus shows a mix across these levels, but coverage is not uniform. To increase confidence and reliability, a source registry should be applied consistently, mapping each asset to its origin and official status.

### Table 9. Credibility Levels Summary

| Level   | Count | Notes                                                   |
|---------|-------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| High    | Not computed | Requires registry-based classification                   |
| Medium  | Not computed | Requires registry-based classification                   |
| Unknown | Majority      | Needs mapping to verified sources and official portals   |

![Evidence supporting source authenticity and capture context.](/workspace/browser/screenshots/atom_wikipedia_page_loaded.png)

The screenshot above demonstrates how the capture context (e.g., Wikipedia page) can be linked to authoritative sources. However, classification must be consistent: the same asset can contain mixed provenance signals (e.g., extracted summaries and original references), necessitating a structured mapping to registries of credible portals and official repositories.

### Table 10. Source Mapping Registry (Structure)

| Field                 | Description                                   |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Asset Identifier      | Unique ID or canonical path                   |
| Observed Source       | Original portal/platform                      |
| Source Type           | Official/Government, OER, Commercial          |
| Credibility Level     | High/Medium/Unknown                           |
| Evidence/Notes        | Capture context, references, screenshots      |
| Licensing Status      | Known/Unknown; attribution requirement        |

## Licensing Compliance and Attribution

Licensing artifacts include an ATTRIBUTION.md file and a DIKSHA license register CSV. These suggest an intent to track attribution and licensing. However, coverage is not universal across the corpus; many assets lack per-file licensing tags. We recommend enforcing a standardized license field at the asset level and automating checks against known licenses, especially for DIKSHA OER and other public educational materials.

### Table 11. Licensing Compliance Matrix

## Quality Assessment and Coverage Gaps

Quality assessment draws on completeness, consistency, and redundancy indicators. Completeness is adequate in GA and Current Affairs but uneven across subjects and years. Consistency is challenged by incomplete language tagging and non-uniform credibility classification. Redundancy requires systematic deduplication; hashes are available but not yet exploited for automated duplicate detection.

Performance indicators are generally healthy: most files are medium-sized, indicating good density. However, the presence of a very large file and numerous large assets suggests targeted performance audits, particularly for downloads and DIKSHA Math.

| Topic Area           | Status        | Evidence                                      | Recommendation                                      |
|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Syllabus Mapping     | Incomplete    | Per-file tags absent                          | Create taxonomy; tag per topic/subtopic             |
| Bilingual Coverage   | Incomplete    | “Mixed/Unknown” majority                      | Re-tag assets; enforce language standards           |
| Current Affairs 2025 | Sparse        | 2024 present; 2025 limited                    | Expand 2025 coverage; ensure monthly continuity     |
| Previous Papers CBTs | Unclear       | CBT1/CBT2 dirs exist                          | Itemize per cycle/year; verify completeness         |
| Licensing Coverage   | Partial       | ATTRIBUTION.md and register present           | Apply per-file license tags; automate checks        |
| Credibility Tags     | Non-uniform   | Levels present but inconsistent               | Apply registry mapping; validate against sources    |
| Duplication          | Unassessed    | Hashes available but not used for dedup       | Implement hash-based duplicate detection            |
| Performance          | Mixed         | One >100MB; many large files                  | Benchmark; compress/segment large assets            |

### Table 14. Quality Metrics Dashboard

| Metric                 | Status         | Notes                                           |
|------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Completeness           | Moderate       | Broad subject areas; metadata gaps persist      |
| Consistency            | Moderate       | Language and credibility tags need work         |
| Redundancy             | Unassessed     | Hashes not yet used for dedup                   |
| Performance            | Healthy        | Mostly medium files; large assets flagged       |

#### Performance and Storage Benchmarks

Large assets should be evaluated for read and transfer performance under realistic conditions. Where documents are monolithic (e.g., long PDFs), segmentation by chapter or section can improve usability and load times. Compression strategies should be applied where lossless quality is preserved and licensing permits. Very large files (>100 MB) warrant focused attention to identify optimization opportunities and to ensure they do not become bottlenecks in downstream processing.

## Recommendations and Improvement Roadmap

The roadmap prioritizes immediate actions to stabilize metadata, followed by medium-term initiatives to automate quality assurance and sustain coverage.

### Immediate (0–2 weeks)

- Complete language tagging for all assets (en, hi, multi) based on file path and metadata inspection.  
- Map all items to a syllabus taxonomy; ensure each asset carries topic/subtopic tags aligned to the relevant exam standards.  
- Populate licensing fields for every asset and apply ATTRIBUTION.md templates consistently, especially for DIKSHA and OER-derived content.  
- Apply a source registry to assign credibility levels consistently and link assets to verified sources.

### Medium-term (2–6 weeks)

- Automate metadata validation: required fields, canonical formats, and values.  
- Implement duplicate detection using SHA-256 hashes and establish canonical sources.  
- Expand bilingual coverage and align current affairs to include complete 2025 timelines; standardize year-by-category continuity.  
- Establish monthly current affairs updates and per-cycle previous paper collections to avoid temporal gaps.

### Long-term (6+ weeks)

- Institutionalize continuous auditing with periodic scans and dashboard reporting.  
- Integrate licensing automation into the asset pipeline, including attribution generation and license registry cross-checks.  
- Create a content performance benchmarking suite for large assets and implement scheduled optimizations.  
- Formalize curriculum alignment workflows, ensuring new content is tagged and validated before publication.

## Concluding Remarks

The corpus exhibits strong breadth, with substantive collections across GA, Mathematics, Reasoning, Science, and Current Affairs, alongside a sizable RRB NTPC base and valuable browser-extracted materials. The next phase of maturity depends on rigorous metadata completion—especially language tagging—systematic credibility mapping and source tracing, and robust licensing compliance. Implementing automated quality checks (duplicate detection, metadata validation) and instituting a continuous audit regimen will ensure the collection remains reliable, well-organized, and aligned with curriculum needs.

Information gaps have been explicitly identified and should be addressed with the recommended actions. Per-file language tagging is the highest priority, followed by licensing coverage and credibility mapping. With these enhancements, the corpus will provide a dependable foundation for exam preparation, research workflows, and educational content operations.

# Workspace-Wide SHA-256 Checksum Catalog, Categorization, and Integrity Verification Blueprint

## Executive Summary

This report documents the creation of a complete, reproducible SHA-256 checksum catalog for the entire workspace, the categorization of all discovered assets, and the results of integrity checks and deduplication analysis. The scope encompassed all regular files across the workspace root and major subdirectories, excluding only transient or lock files that do not represent content of record. The outputs are designed to support ongoing audit, quality assurance, and data stewardship, with explicit formats enabling validation, cross-referencing, and operational decision-making.

The processing pipeline generated three core deliverables under the checksums directory: a master SHA-256 manifest, a category-indexed CSV, and an integrity verification report. The master manifest lists every qualifying file with its SHA-256 digest and size in bytes, sorted by relative path to promote stable diffs and easy human review. The CSV organizes the same records by canonical categories aligned to the project’s content model, facilitating category-level analytics and governance. The verification report synthesizes counts and sizes by category, flags duplicates, and confirms that all listed files were processed without errors.

Key outcomes are as follows:
- Total files processed: 1,312
- Total workspace size: 2.66 GB
- Failed files: 0
- Categorization yields: study-materials (381), other (801), previous-papers (20), practice-sets (20), current-affairs (15), metadata (55), logs (20)
- Duplicates detected: 91 checksum families with multiple file paths

The integrity posture is strong: all files were discovered and hashed without errors, and spot verification across a stratified sample confirmed 100% match. The presence of cross-directory duplicates—particularly for items like official documents, standard textbooks, and image assets—suggests opportunities for consolidation and storage optimization. This report concludes with actionable recommendations on deduplication, categorization refinement, validation cadence, and storage governance.

To anchor these statements, the following table summarizes the end-to-end processing results.

Table 1. Summary of outcomes

| Metric                          | Result           |
|---------------------------------|------------------|
| Total files processed           | 1,312            |
| Total workspace size            | 2.66 GB          |
| Failed files                    | 0                |
| Categories detected             | 7                |
| Duplicate checksum families     | 91               |

The absence of failed files and the 100% spot verification success underscore that the catalog is complete, the SHA-256 hashes are accurate, and the outputs are fit for audit and operational use.

## Scope, Inputs, and Exclusions

The scope of this effort covered the entire workspace with a focus on content directories (content, current-affairs, diksha-ga, diksha-math, diksha-science, diksha-reasoning, practice-ga, practice-math, practice-reasoning, downloads, portal-downloads), metadata directories (e.g., metadata, and project-specific metadata folders), and logs directories (e.g., logs and domain-specific log folders). The goal was to produce an exhaustive manifest for all regular files that constitute project assets.

The process discovered a comprehensive set of file types, ranging from documents (PDF), structured data (CSV, JSON), images (PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG), scripts and code (Python), notebooks and logs (MD, LOG, JSONL), and archives (ZIP, BZ2). This breadth reflects the heterogeneous nature of the workspace, which includes source materials, derived content, diagnostics, and metadata.

There were explicit exclusions for ephemeral or lock files that do not represent content of record, notably the browser user data singleton socket. Such paths are transient by nature and would introduce unnecessary noise and potential instability in the catalog. Symlinks were not explicitly called out in the outcomes; their treatment, if any, should be standardized in future runs to ensure consistency (e.g., whether to follow or archive symlinks, and how to represent them in outputs).

## Methodology and Workflow

The checksum generation workflow was engineered for completeness and reproducibility. It comprised five stages: discovery, categorization, hashing, aggregation, and verification.

First, file discovery扫描ed the workspace to enumerate all regular files under the designated directories. Each discovered file was classified using path-based heuristics aligned to the project’s content model. This step ensures that downstream analytics can reason at the category level (e.g., for quality gating or deduplication).

Second, SHA-256 hashes were computed for each file. The algorithm choice provides strong cryptographic assurance and broad tooling support. Sizes in bytes were recorded alongside digests to enable both integrity checks and capacity planning.

Third, aggregation produced two synchronized outputs. The master manifest lists every file once, in relative-path order, with the format: checksum, size in bytes, and relative path. The CSV presents the same records, indexed by category with a header row, to support filtering and analytics.

Fourth, verification included both automated reconciliation and spot checks. Automated checks ensured that every discovered file appears in the master manifest with matching size and digest; spot checks validated a sample across diverse categories and file types. Anomalies—none were observed—would be flagged for triage.

Finally, duplicates were identified purely by checksum equality, without semantic normalization. This approach surfaces both content-level duplicates and cases where distinct paths reference identical bytes (e.g., copies of official documents or reused images). These findings feed the recommendations on consolidation.

## Output Artifacts and Formats

Three artifacts constitute the canonical outputs of this effort. Each is designed for a specific use, yet they are synchronized to refer to the same underlying records.

The master manifest is a sorted list of all qualifying files with SHA-256 and size. It is optimized for diffs, auditing, and reproducible validation. The categorized CSV complements the manifest by enabling category-filtered views and cross-category analytics. The verification report provides a narrative of counts, sizes, duplicate findings, and pass/fail status.

To illustrate the CSV schema, the following table provides a representative sample. The actual duplicates and file paths in this report are taken from the observed results; the sample here uses placeholders to demonstrate structure.

### Master Checksum Manifest

The master manifest enumerates every qualifying file exactly once. The format is: SHA-256 checksum, size in bytes, and relative path. Sorting by relative path provides stable ordering, making diffs meaningful and audit trails easier to interpret. All 1,312 discovered files are represented; no failures were observed.

### Category-indexed CSV

The CSV mirrors the manifest but adds a category column. This structure enables efficient filtering by category for targeted analyses, such as identifying duplicates within study-materials or verifying logs coverage. The categorization yields seven categories, with counts detailed later in this report.

### Integrity Verification Report

The verification report summarizes the counts and sizes by category, lists duplicate checksum families, and confirms success status. It is the single source of truth for verification outcomes and the starting point for any remediation actions.

## Results and Findings

The discovery phase identified 1,312 files totaling 2.66 GB. The distribution spans seven categories, with study-materials and other comprising the bulk of the corpus. No files failed to process, and the integrity checks passed all tests.

Table 4. Category-wise file count and size

| Category        | File Count | Total Size (MB) |
|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| study-materials | 381        | 2129.73         |
| other           | 801        | 284.39          |
| previous-papers | 20         | 36.03           |
| practice-sets   | 20         | 2.37            |
| current-affairs | 15         | 265.65          |
| metadata        | 55         | 3.32            |
| logs            | 20         | 0.37            |

Study-materials dominate the storage footprint, reflecting the inclusion of extensive textbook and OER collections. The other category is sizable both in count and size, pointing to diverse assets that are not core to the exam-prep taxonomy—such as screenshots, extracted content, and auxiliary scripts—where consolidation and policy-driven retention could yield savings.

### Category Breakdown

- study-materials (381 files; 2129.73 MB): The largest category by far. It includes official textbooks and OER content across mathematics, science, and general awareness, with language variants. The volume underscores the strategic importance of this category for primary learning objectives.
- other (801 files; 284.39 MB): A heterogeneous collection, including browser screenshots, extracted content, and non-canonical assets. While essential for research and QA, the count suggests opportunities to归档 or de-duplicate subsets that are no longer needed for publication.
- previous-papers (20 files; 36.03 MB): Official and sample papers that anchor assessment preparation. Given their relatively modest footprint, this category could be extended with additional coverage if needed.
- practice-sets (20 files; 2.37 MB): Practice materials across GA, economy, polity, geography, science-technology, and static GK. The small size indicates these may be concentrated in a few collections; integrating and normalizing them could aid discoverability.
- current-affairs (15 files; 265.65 MB): Reports, yearbooks, and policy documents. This category contributes disproportionately to size due to a small number of large PDFs; version control and currency tracking will be important.
- metadata (55 files; 3.32 MB): Inventories and catalogs vital for governance. While small in size, this category underpins searchability, QA, and compliance.
- logs (20 files; 0.37 MB): Diagnostic records spanning downloads, mathematics practice sets, and general awareness. These should be retained for traceability but could be rotated or compressed to minimize footprint.

### Duplicate Files Analysis

Duplicates were identified by exact SHA-256 matches. The analysis found 91 duplicate sets, spanning screenshots, official documents, and image assets. Duplication arises through multiple channels: replicated downloads, mirrored content across subject directories, and intentional copies in browser or working directories. For governance, these duplicates do not necessarily indicate error; they do, however, present opportunities to normalize references and reduce storage.

Representative examples observed include:
- Identical economic surveys across adjacent years
- IBPS reasoning guides duplicated between downloads and practice-reasoning
- NCERT mathematics and science textbooks replicated across diksha-math and diksha-science collections
- Extensive screenshot duplicates captured during repeated runs of browser automation

| 454cd94f0d386a9b… | 7               | multiple browser screenshots across states and dates                                                              |
| f988b383a02e4981… | 5               | diksha-math algebra, number system, and statistics textbook variants                                              |

These cases highlight targets for consolidation. In particular, centralizing official documents and standard textbooks with a single canonical path—and replacing alternate copies with references—would reduce footprint and simplify updates.

### Verification Outcomes

Verification achieved full success: 100% of discovered files were hashed and recorded, and spot checks across a stratified sample confirmed digest accuracy. The sample covered screenshots, extracted content, study materials, logs, and metadata across multiple directories.

The integrity verification report confirms these outcomes and should be treated as authoritative. No failed files were recorded, and all checksums match source files.

## Data Quality, Risks, and Limitations

The catalog demonstrates high data quality: no failures occurred during hashing, and the spot verification pass rate was 100%. Nonetheless, several limitations and risks merit attention:

- Path relativization standards are not explicitly documented. While relative paths are used consistently in outputs, formalizing the anchor (e.g., workspace root) and normalization rules (e.g., handling of symlinks and special characters) will improve reproducibility across environments.
- Symlink treatment was not explicitly tracked in the outcomes. Future runs should define whether symlinks are followed, archived as link entities, or excluded, with clear representation in both the manifest and CSV.
- Empty files are not highlighted as a distinct class. In previous runs, empty files can surface with the well-known empty content digest; these should be explicitly tagged in the CSV for visibility.
- Some file classes—especially transient browser states and working directories—may not require long-term retention. Without policy, such files can accumulate and inflate the other category.
- Version currency is uneven across current-affairs subcollections. Annual reports and yearbooks are well represented; other subdomains may lag, which can affect the completeness of coverage for research and exam preparation.

These considerations do not undermine the integrity of the current outputs; rather, they point to areas where standards and automation can further improve the reliability and efficiency of the workspace as a knowledge system.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended:

1. Deduplicate across directories using canonical content paths. Consolidate duplicates such as economic surveys, official notices (e.g., CEN documents), and NCERT textbooks by designating a single authoritative path and replacing redundant copies with references or symbolic links where appropriate.
2. Refine the categorization of the other category. Subdivide other into coherent subcategories—e.g., screenshots, extracted content, and automation artifacts—to improve transparency and facilitate policy-based retention and cleanup.
3. Establish periodic re-verification. Schedule regular recomputation of checksums and automated cross-checks against the master manifest to detect drift, corruption, or accidental deletions. Embed this cadence in CI or nightly jobs for continuous assurance.
4. Standardize path relativization and symlink policies. Document the anchor directory and normalization rules (including treatment of symlinks and special characters), and encode them in the hashing pipeline to ensure consistent outputs across environments.
5. Improve metadata completeness. Extend CSV schema with a MIME type column, content hash algorithm (SHA-256), and a computed field flagging empty files (and, by extension, all zero-byte files). This will support tooling, reduce ambiguity, and streamline QA.
6. Optimize storage for large current-affairs documents. Consider lossless compression or archival strategies for large PDFs with low update frequency, subject to integrity constraints and access patterns.
7. Extend coverage for previous-papers and practice-sets. Fill known gaps to ensure balanced representation across CBT levels and subjects, improving the overall utility of the corpus for aspirants.
8. Update the verification report artifact name. Align the artifact to the naming convention established in prior deliverables to ensure consistency across audit trails and operational runbooks.

These examples show typical paths across categories, including extracted content, screenshots, annual reports, economic surveys, policy documents, yearbooks, and logs.

## Noted Information Gaps

- The precise relativization standard (e.g., exact anchor directory) for path representation in outputs is not stated.
- The handling of symlinks is not explicitly documented in the process outcomes.
- Empty files are not explicitly highlighted; the presence of the empty-file digest observed elsewhere does not appear as a distinct flag in the current dataset.
- Version currency across all current-affairs subdirectories is uneven; some collections are fully current while others appear sparse.
- The distinction between deduplicated and non-deduplicated files within outputs is implicit rather than explicitly marked.

## Conclusion

The workspace-wide SHA-256 cataloging effort has achieved its objectives with high integrity and zero failures. The outputs are complete, consistent, and ready for operational use in audit and QA. The findings reveal both the breadth of the corpus and the presence of cross-directory duplicates suitable for consolidation. By implementing the recommended standards and workflows—especially for deduplication, categorization, and validation—the project can improve efficiency, reduce storage footprint, and sustain a high-integrity knowledge base for exam preparation and research.

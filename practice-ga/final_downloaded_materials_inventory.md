# Blueprint for Collecting RRB NTPC General Awareness Practice Sets and Quiz Materials (English/Hindi) with Syllabus Mapping and Licensing Compliance

## Executive Summary and Objectives

This blueprint sets out a practical, compliance-first plan to collect and organize General Awareness (GA) practice sets and quiz materials for the Railway Recruitment Board Non-Technical Popular Categories (RRB NTPC) examination. The primary objective is to curate topic-wise practice banks—spanning Indian History, Geography, Polity, Economy, Current Affairs, Static General Knowledge (GK), and Science & Technology—available in both English and Hindi where possible, and to do so in strict alignment with the official syllabus and credible exam-pattern sources.

The plan’s outputs include:
- A topic-wise bank of GA materials organized in a standardized directory structure under the designated collection path, with bilingual subfolders where available.
- A metadata schema and index mapping each item to the RRB NTPC syllabus (CBT 1 and CBT 2 applicability).
- Licensing and redistribution documentation that records observed permissions, constraints, and required attribution.

The compliance posture is conservative by design. Where redistribution rights are unclear or restricted, the plan defaults to internal-use curation with attribution and clearly labeled constraints. Where direct downloads are gated by sign-up or redirection (e.g., platform flows), the plan prescribes manual workflows and auditable logs. The approach is anchored to official and widely used pattern and syllabus references to ensure alignment to the exam’s architecture and evolving expectations.[^2][^3][^4]

## Methodology and Source Credibility Review

We adopt a staged methodology:

- Discovery and source vetting: Identify portals that explicitly cover RRB NTPC GA topics and publish practice sets or quizzes. Validate credibility by triangulating section structure, marking scheme, and syllabus coverage with official documents and leading portals.[^1][^2][^3][^4]
- Licensing and redistribution verification: Examine each portal’s terms and observable practices to determine whether content is free to download, restricted to personal use, or governed by sign-up flows. Explicitly avoid sources that block automated downloads or where redistribution terms are not disclosed. Where terms are ambiguous, default to internal use with attribution.
- Acquisition workflow: For free and clearly licensed items, use direct downloads; for gated PDFs (e.g., sign-up required), perform manual downloads within platform rules; for redirection-based portals, capture item-level metadata and maintain an access log; avoid scraping.
- Bilingual prioritization: Prefer sources offering English/Hindi coverage or parallel language pages; where bilingual availability is partial, capture language tags in metadata and plan parity checks.

Table 1. Source credibility and licensing summary (selected portals)

| Portal | NTPC GA Coverage | Redistribution Policy | Bilingual | Access Conditions |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Testbook | Subject-wise GA pages (GK, History, Polity, Geography) with solved items; mock/test series available | “All rights reserved”; free PDFs typically require sign-up; no unauthorized redistribution | Yes (English/Hindi noted on platform) | Sign-up to access free PDFs and practice content[^12][^13][^14][^15] |
| Jagran Josh | GA content, exam-pattern articles, Static GK lists, and mock tests | Terms indicate personal use only; no commercial redistribution | Mixed | Direct access to articles; some mock tests require free registration[^5][^8][^9] |
| RRB Exam Portal | Aggregated PDFs: Current Affairs, Static GK one-liners, sample papers (English/Hindi) | Copyright claimed; free items displayed but often routed via Instamojo; redistribution terms not explicit | English and Hindi pages | Direct access to listing pages; downloads typically via hosted checkout; anti-bot measures may apply[^16][^18][^19][^20][^21][^22][^23][^24] |
| PracticeMock | Curated Current Affairs PDFs for NTPC CBT 2; weekly quizzes | Terms not explicit in the context; download may involve redirection | English | Free PDFs via platform flows; access method recorded in metadata[^7][^11] |
| Railway Capsule | Free bilingual practice sets and notes (online) | Free access; no explicit redistribution clause | Yes (English/Hindi) | Online access; no direct PDFs; use platform for item generation and metadata tagging[^25] |
| Oliveboard | GA preparation guidance, GK “Top 500” and current affairs blogs | Terms not explicit; platform content may be gated | English/Hindi | Free blogs; registration for full access in places[^6] |

Evidence for coverage and policies is drawn from the portals’ NTPC pages and GA-focused articles and PDFs.[^12][^13][^14][^15][^16][^18][^19][^20][^21][^22][^23][^24][^25][^7][^11][^6] Where access is blocked or ambiguous, the plan records the barrier and prescribes manual workflows instead of automated downloads.

## GA Syllabus Taxonomy and CBT 1/CBT 2 Mapping

The General Awareness section in RRB NTPC is broad and integrative. The official-syllabus-aligned document lists GA to include Current Events (National/International), History and Freedom Struggle, Geography (India & World), Polity & Governance, Economy, General Science and Life Science (up to 10th CBSE), Computers and Applications, Common Abbreviations, UN and Other World Organizations, Environmental Issues, Transport Systems, Famous Personalities, and Flagship Government Programs.[^2] Multiple portals corroborate this structure and emphasize Static GK and Current Affairs as high-yield areas.[^5][^6][^9]

Table 2. GA taxonomy mapped to CBT 1 and CBT 2

| Topic Family | CBT 1 | CBT 2 | Notes |
|--------------|-------|-------|-------|
| Current Affairs (National/International) | Yes | Yes | Recency matters; one-liners help rapid revision |
| Static GK (General Knowledge) | Yes | Yes | Awards, important days, personalities, organizations |
| Indian History (Ancient/Medieval/Modern; Freedom Struggle) | Yes | Yes (expanded) | CBT 2 often deepens coverage on dynasties and reformers |
| Geography (India & World: Physical/Social/Economic) | Yes | Yes (expanded) | Maps/data interpretation more prominent in CBT 2 |
| Polity & Governance | Yes | Yes (expanded) | Constitutional articles andParliamentary procedure emphasized |
| Economy | Yes | Yes | Banking, budget, indicators, and basic concepts |
| Science & Technology | Yes | Yes | General science basics; Indian space and nuclear programs |
| Computers & Abbreviations | Yes | Yes | GA includes basics of computers and common abbreviations |
| Organizations (UN and others) | Yes | Yes | Institutional awareness tested |
| Environment & Biodiversity | Yes | Yes | Environmental issues and flora/fauna |
| Art/Culture/Literature/Monuments | Yes | Yes | Indian heritage and culture |
| Transport Systems | Yes | Yes | Indian transport systems and infrastructure |
| Personalities | Yes | Yes | Famous personalities of India and the world |
| Government Schemes | Yes | Yes | Flagship schemes and policy updates |

This taxonomy anchors topic-wise curation and enables precise metadata tagging for CBT 1/CBT 2 coverage. It also supports bilingual coverage checks and content prioritization.[^2][^5][^6][^9]

## Topic-wise Collection Plan (Indian History, Geography, Polity, Economy, Current Affairs, Static GK, Science & Technology)

For each topic family, the plan pairs the official syllabus with credible sources and a practical acquisition method that respects licensing terms and access constraints. Bilingual availability is tracked in metadata, and CBT applicability is tagged per item.

Table 3. Source-to-topic acquisition plan and bilingual coverage

| Topic | Primary Sources | Material Type | Language | Acquisition Method | CBT Applicability |
|-------|------------------|---------------|----------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Indian History | Testbook History[^13]; Jagran Josh Static GK lists[^9] | Solved MCQs; curated lists | EN/HI via portals | Sign-up PDFs (Testbook); internal curation from articles | CBT 1/CBT 2 |
| Geography | Testbook Geography[^14]; Jagran Josh Static GK[^9] | Solved MCQs; lists | EN/HI via portals | Sign-up PDFs (Testbook); curated notes | CBT 1/CBT 2 |
| Polity | Testbook Polity[^15]; Jagran Josh Static GK[^9] | Solved MCQs; lists | EN/HI via portals | Sign-up PDFs (Testbook); curated notes | CBT 1/CBT 2 |
| Economy | Jagran Josh Static GK[^9]; Oliveboard GK blogs[^6] | MCQs; curated lists | EN/HI | Internal curation; weightage guidance | CBT 1/CBT 2 |
| Current Affairs | PracticeMock PDF[^11]; RRB Exam Portal CA PDF[^18]; Oliveboard current affairs[^6] | One-liner PDFs; monthly compilations | EN/HI (partial) | Direct PDF where allowed; metadata for gated access | CBT 1/CBT 2 |
| Static GK | RRB Exam Portal one-liners[^19]; Jagran Josh[^9]; Oliveboard GK[^6] | One-liner banks; MCQs | EN/HI | Direct download where permitted; otherwise internal curation | CBT 1/CBT 2 |
| Science & Technology | Testbook GK Science items[^12]; Jagran Josh GA pages[^9] | MCQs; solved sets | EN/HI | Sign-up PDFs; internal curation | CBT 1/CBT 2 |

Testbook’s subject pages are particularly useful for solved practice with explanations; however, redistribution is restricted, which necessitates internal-use metadata and item-level notes.[^12][^13][^14][^15] Jagran Josh’s lists and exam-pattern content help calibrate breadth and recurring themes.[^5][^9] Railway Capsule adds bilingual, online practice to diversify item formats and test difficulty without bulk PDF downloads.[^25] PracticeMock’s curated one-liner current affairs offer high-density revision and align well to GA patterns; access flows are documented in metadata.[^7][^11] RRB Exam Portal pages expand Static GK and Current Affairs coverage in English and Hindi; where hosting or checkout pages are present, we record access constraints and prioritize item-level notes and manual downloads within displayed terms.[^16][^18][^19][^20][^21][^22][^23][^24]

## Licensing and Redistribution Compliance Plan

Compliance is non-negotiable. The plan enforces three principles:

- Respect platform terms. For Testbook and similar portals that claim “All rights reserved,” do not redistribute PDFs; use topic pages and solved items to inform internal curation and metadata tagging, not republishing.[^12][^13][^14][^15]  
- Honor “Personal use only.” For Jagran Josh and comparable portals, retain content in internal repositories with attribution, avoid commercial redistribution, and record the personal-use basis in metadata.[^5][^9]  
- Clarify ambiguous terms. For RRB Exam Portal, Railway Capsule, and SSC Study, maintain a permissions log, default to internal use with attribution, and request explicit permission before any external sharing. Where access requires hosting fees or redirection (e.g., checkout flows), capture the process and avoid bulk hosting without clear rights.[^16][^18][^19][^20][^21][^22][^23][^24][^10]

Table 4. Licensing matrix and allowed uses

| Portal | License/Policy Signal | Allowed Uses | Redistribution | Action |
|--------|------------------------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Testbook | All rights reserved; free PDFs gated[^12][^13][^14][^15] | Personal study; internal curation | No (without permission) | Use metadata and internal notes; no PDF republishing |
| Jagran Josh | Personal use only[^5][^9] | Personal study; internal curation | No commercial redistribution | Cite source; avoid bulk PDF hosting |
| RRB Exam Portal | Copyright claimed; free items via hosted pages[^16][^18][^19][^20][^21][^22][^23][^24] | Personal study | Not explicit; likely restricted | Manual downloads within terms; record access; internal use |
| PracticeMock | Free PDFs via platform[^7][^11] | Personal study | Not specified | Document access flow; attribute |
| Railway Capsule | Free access; no explicit redistribution[^25] | Personal study | Not specified | Seek permission; internal use until clarified |
| Oliveboard | Platform terms; blogs free[^6] | Personal study | Not specified | Attribute; avoid redistribution |
| SSC Study | Free PDFs; publisher rights[^10] | Personal study | Not specified | Confirm rights; attribute |

Attribution templates will include portal name, title, source URL, access date, and any displayed license notice. This ensures audit-ready documentation and alignment with academic norms.

## Directory Structure and File Organization

The collection is organized to reflect the GA taxonomy, maintain bilingual parity, and enable machine-parseable audits. The structure uses topic directories with English and Hindi subfolders and standardized filenames that embed source and language.

Proposed structure under the designated collection path:
- indian-history/
  - english/
  - hindi/
- geography/
  - english/
  - hindi/
- polity/
  - english/
  - hindi/
- economy/
  - english/
  - hindi/
- current-affairs/
  - english/
  - hindi/
- static-gk/
  - english/
  - hindi/
- science-technology/
  - english/
  - hindi/
- metadata/
- compliance/

File naming convention:
<topic>-<subtopic>-<source>-<language>-<date>.<ext>

Examples:
- current-affairs-one-liners-practicemock-en-2025-10.pdf
- static-gk-one-liners-rrbexamportal-hi-2025-10.pdf

Each item includes YAML front matter with metadata (source, license, language, topic tags, CBT 1/CBT 2 flags, question count, access method) and a mirrored index for automated reporting. This structure mirrors the directory plan and standardizes metadata fields.

## Metadata Schema and Syllabus Mapping

Metadata ensures traceability and exam alignment. Each practice file includes structured fields captured in the file header and indexed in a master registry.

Table 5. Metadata field dictionary and sample values

| Field | Description | Sample |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| title | Item title | “Current Affairs One-liners (Mar–Aug 2025)” |
| source_name | Portal/publisher | “PracticeMock” |
| source_url | Source page/PDF URL | “Direct PDF (see references)” |
| license_type | Observed license | “Free PDF with attribution” |
| redistribution_allowed | Yes/No/Internal-only | “Internal-only” |
| language | en/hi | “en” |
| topics | GA taxonomy tags | “current-affairs, static-gk” |
| cbt1_applicable | yes/no | “yes” |
| cbt2_applicable | yes/no | “yes” |
| question_count | Integer | 500 |
| answer_key_available | yes/no | “yes” |
| date_accessed | ISO date | 2025-10-30 |
| notes | Access or license notes | “Access via platform flow; record in metadata” |

Table 6. CBT 1/CBT 2 applicability by GA topic family

| Topic Family | CBT 1 | CBT 2 |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| Current Affairs | Yes | Yes |
| Static GK | Yes | Yes |
| History | Yes | Yes (expanded) |
| Geography | Yes | Yes (expanded) |
| Polity | Yes | Yes (expanded) |
| Economy | Yes | Yes |
| Science & Technology | Yes | Yes |
| Computers & Abbreviations | Yes | Yes |
| Organizations | Yes | Yes |
| Environment | Yes | Yes |
| Art/Culture/Literature/Monuments | Yes | Yes |
| Transport Systems | Yes | Yes |
| Personalities | Yes | Yes |
| Government Schemes | Yes | Yes |

Mapping draws from the official syllabus and corroborating portal pages and supports rapid generation of stage-specific practice sheets.[^2][^5][^6]

## Download and Organization Workflow

Execution follows a source-specific playbook:

- Direct downloads (free PDFs): Capture item-level metadata and save per topic-language subfolder with attribution and license tags.  
- Gated PDFs (sign-up required): Record the access method; download only if terms permit; otherwise, use item-level notes to guide internal curation (e.g., practice item types, solution styles) without republishing source content.  
- Manual/interactive access (anti-bot/redirects): Log access steps and avoid scraping; favor item-level notes and metadata.  
- Validation: Confirm license allowability; tag language; tag CBT applicability; update the metadata index and change log.

Table 7. Portal acquisition checklist and fallback routes

| Portal | Access | Gating | Redirects/Anti-bot | Fallback |
|--------|--------|--------|---------------------|----------|
| Testbook[^12][^13][^14][^15] | Sign-up PDFs | Yes | Possible | Internal curation; no redistribution |
| Jagran Josh[^5][^9] | Articles/Mock tests | Sometimes | Possible | Item-level notes; personal use |
| RRB Exam Portal[^16][^18][^19][^20][^21][^22][^23][^24] | Listing pages; hosted downloads | Sometimes | Yes (Instamojo/redirects) | Record steps; manual download |
| PracticeMock[^7][^11] | Free PDFs via platform | Sometimes | Yes | Download where permitted; metadata |
| Oliveboard[^6] | Blogs; registration for full access | Sometimes | Possible | Weightage guidance; avoid redistribution |
| Railway Capsule[^25] | Online quizzes and notes | No | Possible | Bilingual practice feed; generate items |
| SSC Study[^10] | Free PDFs | No | Possible | Confirm publisher rights |

This workflow ensures that downloads occur within displayed terms, that anti-bot protections are respected, and that audit trails are complete.

## Quality Assurance and Update Plan

Quality assurance addresses content integrity and compliance hygiene:

- Content QA: Validate factual accuracy, difficulty alignment, and completeness against the GA taxonomy; ensure Current Affairs items remain recent; review Science & Technology items for alignment to Indian space and nuclear programmes and GA-level computer basics.  
- Compliance QA: Periodically audit license terms, confirm permission status, and maintain a change log; proactively avoid redistribution where terms restrict such use.  
- Update cadence: Static GK quarterly; Current Affairs monthly; Science & Technology semi-annually; CBT 2 depth items (History/Geography/Polity/Economy) semi-annually based on mock-test weightages and GA lists.[^6][^9]

Table 8. QA checklist

| Dimension | Checks | Frequency | Owner |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| Accuracy | Factual validation; source corroboration | Quarterly (Static GK); Monthly (Current Affairs) | Content QA Lead |
| Coverage | Taxonomy completeness; parity across EN/HI | Quarterly | Subject Editors |
| Difficulty | Alignment to CBT patterns | Semi-annual | Exam Prep Lead |
| Compliance | License review; permissions; redistribution logs | Quarterly | Compliance Officer |
| Metadata | Field completeness; CBT tags; language tags | Ongoing | Metadata Steward |

This cadence ensures materials stay accurate, relevant, and compliant.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

Three classes of risk are anticipated:

- Redistribution ambiguity: Several portals do not explicitly permit redistribution. Mitigation: internal-use curation with attribution; permissions log; outreach where necessary.  
- Anti-bot and gating: Some resources route through hosted checkout pages or require sign-up. Mitigation: manual workflows; access logs; avoid scraping.  
- Bilingual coverage gaps: Not all sources guarantee Hindi availability for each item. Mitigation: language tags; parity tracking; explicit search for Hindi variants; targeted QA.

Table 9. Risk register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Unclear redistribution terms | High | Medium | Default to internal use; document source terms | Compliance |
| Gated/redirected access | Medium | Medium | Manual downloads; access logs | Content Ops |
| Hindi parity gaps | Medium | Medium | Track language tags; seek Hindi variants | Metadata |
| Outdated Current Affairs | Medium | High | Monthly refresh; retirement policy | Current Affairs Editor |
| Policy changes | Low | Medium | Quarterly audit; change log | Compliance |

These mitigations align with observed portal behaviors and the plan’s compliance-first stance.

## Executive Summary

This report completes a two-part objective: first, a quality verification of two items previously labeled as RRB Exam Portal PDFs; second, an expansion plan to address subject-wise gaps in General Awareness (GA) coverage for RRB NTPC, with emphasis on Indian History, Geography, Polity, and Economy.

The verification conclusively establishes that the two RRB Exam Portal items currently labeled as PDFs are, in fact, HTML documents. Both are associated with paid downloads via Instamojo: “RRB GK 1000 One-Liner Questions” (listed at ₹29) and “RRB Current Affairs Jan–Aug 2025” (listed at ₹19) and therefore cannot be treated as freely redistributable PDFs. This finding triggers clear remediation actions: remove the HTML artifacts from the collection and record the paid nature of these resources with a do-not-redistribute flag.

The expansion work identified multiple high-value sources for History, Geography, Polity, and Economy. However, most are gated behind sign-up or subscription (e.g., Testbook, Cracku, Scribd). We secured one additional open PDF from Adda247 that compiles GA questions asked across NTPC phases, which improves coverage without licensing friction. The current state of the collection has strong current affairs materials and a workable baseline in static GK and general science, but remains sparse in downloadable, open-access PDFs for History, Geography, Polity, and Economy.

Table 1 summarizes the verification outcomes and remediation recommendations. Table 2 provides a high-level snapshot of coverage versus needs across the GA taxonomy. To avoid introducing hyperlinks in the body, the references section lists all sources, and we cite them by footnote marker.

Table 1. Verification summary of RRB Exam Portal items
| Filename (as stored) | Detected type | Actual content | Monetization | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| rrb_exam_portal_1000_one_liners.pdf | HTML document | Product page for “RRB GK 1000 One-Liner Questions” | Paid (₹29) via Instamojo | Remove from collection; log as paid, non-redistributable |
| rrb_exam_portal_current_affairs.pdf | HTML document | Product page for “RRB Current Affairs Jan–Aug 2025” | Paid (₹19) via Instamojo | Remove from collection; log as paid, non-redistributable |

As a result, the collection is leaner but cleaner: we removed two HTML artifacts and added an accessible Adda247 PDF of NTPC GA questions. The licensing posture is now more conservative and coherent, and the coverage map clarifies where to focus next acquisition efforts for maximum syllabus alignment.[^16][^17][^21][^22][^23][^24][^1][^2][^7][^11]

## Verification of RRB Exam Portal Files

The two items were suspected to be HTML rather than PDFs based on prior indicators. We validated this using a standard file-type probe and corroborated the product context by reviewing the associated listing pages. Both items resolve to product pages that funnel users into a paid checkout on Instamojo rather than offering a free, direct PDF.

Key observations:
- Both items resolve to product pages, not downloadable PDFs.
- Pricing is visible on the pages (₹29 for GK one-liners; ₹19 for the Current Affairs e-book), with payment via Instamojo.
- No free preview is provided on the product pages.
- The pages do not grant redistribution rights; they are clearly commercial listings.

Table 2 consolidates the evidence and records the recommended actions.

Table 2. RRB Exam Portal items: evidence and remediation
| Item (as stored) | Detected type | Pricing | Payment method | Evidence ref | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| rrb_exam_portal_1000_one_liners.pdf | HTML document | ₹29 | Instamojo | [^21], [^23], [^24] | Remove HTML file; log paid product with no redistribution |
| rrb_exam_portal_current_affairs.pdf | HTML document | ₹19 | Instamojo | [^22], [^23], [^24] | Remove HTML file; log paid product with no redistribution |

To visually document the environment in which these artifacts were found, we include local screenshots referenced by this report.

![RRB Exam Portal – ebook download section with gated access](/workspace/browser/screenshots/rrb_exam_portal_downloadable_resources.png)

Interpretation: The HTML artifacts are not valid PDFs and are part of a commercial flow. They should not reside in the materials repository. Instead, the collection should maintain a compliance note indicating that these items exist as paid products and must not be redistributed.

## Remediation and Compliance Updates

The following actions were completed to restore integrity and enforce licensing discipline:

- Removed the two HTML files from the Current Affairs and Static GK directories to eliminate misclassification and prevent accidental reuse.
- Created and enforced a do-not-redistribute flag for these paid RRB Exam Portal products in the metadata and licensing logs.
- Retained one open-access Adda247 PDF that compiles GA questions asked across NTPC phases, strengthening coverage without licensing friction.

Table 3 documents the changes.

Table 3. Change log of remediation actions
| Timestamp | Action | Rationale | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current cycle | Removed HTML artifacts mislabeled as PDFs | Eliminate misclassification; avoid accidental redistribution | Content operations |
| Current cycle | Added compliance tag “paid, no redistribution” to RRB Exam Portal items | Preserve a record of the existence and nature of these resources | Compliance lead |
| Current cycle | Integrated Adda247 GA NTPC PDF into the collection | Improve coverage using open-access content | Content operations |

These steps align the collection with a conservative licensing posture and reduce operational risk. As additional gates and paid flows are encountered (e.g., Instamojo checkouts, sign-up modals), they are being logged consistently in the access and redistribution metadata.[^23][^24][^1]

## Expansion: Subject-wise Acquisition Plan for History, Geography, Polity, Economy

We used a structured search strategy to identify downloadable PDFs and portals with RRB-aligned practice materials for the four subjects with the largest gaps: History, Geography, Polity, and Economy. Selection favored sources that align with the NTPC syllabus and exam pattern, provide English/Hindi options where possible, and minimize redistribution risk.

Several high-value targets surfaced with varying access conditions:

- Cracku offers subject-specific PDFs for Geography and Polity, and a smaller Economy set, but requires sign-up or login for downloads.
- Testbook provides solved question PDFs across History and Economics, with access gated behind sign-up.
- Exampundit hosts an Economy one-liner PDF and a history notes PDF, both requiring sign-in.
- Scribd hosts multi-hundred-page previous year question compilations for History and Geography behind a subscription or free-trial wall.
- SSC STUDY hosts Google Drive links for multiple RRB books and practice sets that are positioned as free downloads.

Table 4 summarizes the acquisition landscape.

Table 4. Candidate sources by subject and access condition
| Subject | Source | Document type | Access condition | Bilingual | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| History | Testbook | Solved MCQs (RRB NTPC History) | Sign-up required | Not stated | Manual account-based download, English-only[^12] |
| History | Exampundit | Important History Notes (SSC & Railway) | Sign-in required | Not stated | Manual sign-in, metadata capture[^33] |
| History | Scribd | Railway History PYQ compilation | Subscription/free trial | Not stated | Subscription path; log access[^34] |
| Geography | Cracku | Top-100 Expected NTPC Geography | Sign-up required | Telugu variant noted | Manual account-based download[^10] |
| Geography | Scribd | Railway Geography PYQ (139 pages) | Subscription/free trial | Not stated | Subscription path; log access[^35] |
| Geography | Jagran Josh | Practice topics and questions | Free articles; some registration | Not stated | Use as reference; no PDF planned[^9] |
| Polity | Cracku | Top-100 Expected NTPC Polity & Governance | Sign-up required | Telugu variant noted | Manual account-based download[^4] |
| Polity | Testbook | RRB Group D/ALP Polity MCQs | Sign-up required | Not stated | Manual sign-in, English-only[^13] |
| Economy | Cracku | Top-25 Group-D Economy Questions | Sign-up required | Telugu variant noted | Manual account-based download[^28] |
| Economy | Exampundit | Indian Economy One-liner (13 pages) | Sign-in required | Not stated | Manual sign-in; metadata capture[^29] |
| Multi-subject baseline | SSC STUDY | RRB books/practice sets (English/Hindi) | Google Drive links | Yes | Validate licensing; download selective items[^32] |
| Additional coverage | Adda247 | GA questions asked in NTPC (already added) | Direct PDF | Not stated | Already integrated; leverage for cross-topic practice[^1] |

Notes:
- “Not stated” indicates the language support was not explicitly confirmed in the captured context.
- For sources requiring sign-up or subscription, only manual, policy-compliant acquisition is proposed; automated scraping or circumvention is out of scope.

## Current Coverage vs Needs

The current collection is solid on Current Affairs and has a usable baseline in Static GK and General Science. It is comparatively lighter in downloadable PDFs for History, Geography, Polity, and Economy—precisely the areas that benefit from structured, chapter-wise practice.

Table 5 contrasts current coverage against the GA taxonomy.

Table 5. Coverage matrix: Current materials vs GA taxonomy
| Topic family | Current status | Representative sources (open/added) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current Affairs | Strong | PracticeMock 500+ Current Affairs; Adda247 NTPC GA compilation | Monthly/compilation PDFs available; high utility for rapid revision[^7][^11][^1] |
| Static GK | Adequate baseline | YCT Fastbook RRB GK (one-liners) | One-liners support quick recall; expand with topic-wise sets[^24] |
| General Science | Baseline available | ResearchGate RRB General Science (via redirection) | Verify content quality; confirm exam relevance[^26] |
| History | Sparse (downloadable PDFs) | Testbook (sign-up), Exampundit (sign-in), Scribd (subscription) | Focus on chapter-wise MCQs and PYQ compilations[^12][^33][^34] |
| Geography | Sparse (downloadable PDFs) | Cracku (sign-up), Scribd (subscription), Jagran Josh articles | Prioritize maps/India & World themes; add Telugu variant if helpful[^10][^35][^9] |
| Polity & Governance | Sparse (downloadable PDFs) | Cracku (sign-up), Testbook (sign-up) | Target constitutional articles and parliamentary procedure[^4][^13] |
| Economy | Sparse (downloadable PDFs) | Cracku (sign-up), Exampundit (sign-in) | Add one-liners and basic concepts for CBT 1/2[^28][^29] |

The immediate priority is to convert gated or subscription-based sources into compliant, audit-ready acquisitions (manual downloads) and identify one or two open-access additions per subject. This will balance coverage with the project’s licensing and audit constraints.

## Appendices

### Appendix A: Evidence screenshots and page context

The screenshots below provide visual corroboration of the gated nature of certain downloads and the product flow encountered on RRB Exam Portal.

![RRB Exam Portal – gated download section (product flow)](/workspace/browser/screenshots/rrb_exam_portal_downloadable_resources.png)

### Appendix B: Assumptions and constraints

- We operate a conservative licensing posture: if redistribution terms are not explicitly permissive, items are flagged for internal use only or excluded.
- Automated downloading from gated platforms is out of scope; manual, policy-compliant acquisition is used where permissible.
- We avoid introducing hyperlinks in the body and cite sources via footnotes to maintain document integrity.

### Information gaps (to be monitored)
- The two RRB Exam Portal items are not free PDFs; they are paid products via Instamojo. This report confirms they are HTML and not valid PDFs. Manual, compliant acquisition would require purchase and explicit permission; otherwise, they must remain non-redistributable references only.[^16][^17][^20][^23][^24]
- Testbook, Cracku, Exampundit, and Scribd materials are typically gated behind sign-up or subscription. Open-access availability is limited; manual workflows are necessary where permissible.[^12][^4][^10][^28][^29][^33][^34][^35]
- Railway Capsule currently offers online tests, not direct PDFs; development status is indicated as ongoing.[^25]
- Bilingual parity is partial across sources; language support should be verified during acquisition and tagged in metadata.[^5]
- The General Science PDF is accessed via a ResearchGate redirect; relevance to the RRB GA section should be confirmed prior to integration.[^26]

        <h1>Statistics</h1>
        
        <div class="infobox">
            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>Statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It is both the science of uncertainty and the technology of extracting information from data. Statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments.</p>

            <h2>Descriptive Statistics</h2>
            <p>A method of data analysis that summarizes data from a sample using indexes. It quantitatively describes or summarizes features of a collection of information and is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, not assuming the data comes from a larger population. It often concerns properties of a distribution such as central tendency (location) and dispersion (variability).</p>

            <h2>Inferential Statistics</h2>
            <p>A method of data analysis that draws conclusions from data that are subject to random variation (e.g., observational errors, sampling variation). It is the process of using data analysis to deduce properties of an underlying probability distribution, inferring properties of a population by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Central Tendency (Measures of Location)</h2>
            <p>Statistics that identify the center or typical value of a data distribution.</p>
            
            <h3>Mean</h3>
            <p>An index used in descriptive statistics to summarize data from a sample. It is considered an elementary summary of data, characterizing the central or typical value of a distribution (central tendency).</p>
            
            <h3>Median</h3>
            <p>A measure of central tendency. The median is the middle value in a list of numbers sorted in ascending order.</p>
            
            <h3>Mode</h3>
            <p>A measure of central tendency. The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Dispersion (Variability)</h2>
            <p>Statistics that measure the spread or variability of data points around the central value.</p>
            
            <h3>Standard Deviation</h3>
            <p>An index used in descriptive statistics to summarize data from a sample. It refers to the extent to which individual observations in a sample differ from a central value, such as the sample or population mean.</p>
            
            <h3>Variance</h3>
            <p>A measure of dispersion introduced by Ronald Fisher. The variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Probability</h2>
            <p>Statistics is based on probability, which is a branch of mathematics that studies random events and deals with the analysis of random phenomena. Probability theory provides the framework for mathematical statistics.</p>
            
            <p>Although probability and statistics were once paired together as a single subject, they are conceptually distinct from one another. The former is based on deducing answers to specific situations from a general theory of probability, meanwhile statistics induces statements about a population based on a data set.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Distribution</h2>
            <p>Descriptive statistics are concerned with properties of a 'distribution' (sample or population). These properties include:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Central tendency:</strong> Characterizing the typical value</li>
                <li><strong>Dispersion:</strong> Characterizing the extent to which members depart from the center</li>
                <li><strong>Shape of the distribution:</strong> Understanding the overall pattern of data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The normal distribution is given as a common example of a probability density, used extensively in inferential statistics.</p>

            <h2>Key Concepts Summary</h2>
            
            <h3>Types of Statistics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Descriptive Statistics:</strong> Summarizes and describes data from a sample</li>
                <li><strong>Inferential Statistics:</strong> Makes predictions or inferences about a population based on sample data</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Measures of Central Tendency</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mean:</strong> Average of all values</li>
                <li><strong>Median:</strong> Middle value when data is ordered</li>
                <li><strong>Mode:</strong> Most frequently occurring value</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Measures of Dispersion</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Range:</strong> Difference between highest and lowest values</li>
                <li><strong>Variance:</strong> Average squared deviation from the mean</li>
                <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> Square root of variance</li>
            </ul>

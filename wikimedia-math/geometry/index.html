            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>Geometry is defined as a branch of mathematics concerned with properties of space including distance, shape, size, and relative position of figures. Euclidean geometry, until the 19th century, was almost exclusively focused on notions such as point, line, plane, distance, angle, surface, and curve as fundamental concepts.</p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>Points</h2>
            <p>Generally considered fundamental objects for building geometry. Euclid defined them as 'that which has no part'. In modern mathematics, they are typically defined as elements of a set called space, axiomatically defined. Geometric shapes are defined as sets of points in this context. Some modern geometries, like Whitehead's point-free geometry, exist without points as primitive objects.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Lines</h2>
            <p>Euclid described a line as 'breadthless length' which 'lies equally with respect to the points on itself'. In modern mathematics, its definition varies: in analytic geometry, a line in the plane is a set of points satisfying a linear equation; in incidence geometry, it can be an independent object distinct from its points; in differential geometry, a geodesic generalizes the concept of a line to curved spaces.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Lines</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Line Segment:</strong> A portion of a line with two endpoints</li>
                <li><strong>Ray:</strong> A line with one endpoint extending infinitely in one direction</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Planes</h2>
            <p>In Euclidean geometry, a plane is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely. Definitions for other geometries generalize this. Planes can be studied as topological surfaces (without reference to distances or angles), affine spaces (collinearity and ratios, but not distances), or the complex plane (using complex analysis techniques).</p>

            <h2>Angles</h2>
            
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                <img src="images/Angle_obtuse_acute_straight.svg" alt="Types of Angles" style="max-width: 400px; width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" />
                <p style="font-style: italic; color: #666; margin-top: 10px;">Acute (a), obtuse (b), and straight (c) angles</p>
            </div>
            <p>Euclid defines a plane angle as the inclination to each other, in a plane, of two lines which meet and do not lie straight. In modern terms, an angle is the figure formed by two rays (sides) sharing a common endpoint (vertex). The size of an angle is formalized as an angular measure. Angles are fundamental in Euclidean geometry, trigonometry (e.g., unit circle), and their calculation in differential geometry uses derivatives.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Angles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Acute Angle:</strong> Less than 90°</li>
                <li><strong>Obtuse Angle:</strong> Greater than 90° but less than 180°</li>
                <li><strong>Straight Angle:</strong> Exactly 180°</li>
                <li><strong>Oblique Angle:</strong> Includes acute and obtuse angles</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Triangles</h2>
            <p>A type of polygon studied in Euclidean geometry. Key concepts include altitude, hypotenuse, and the Pythagorean theorem. 'Rational triangles' have rational sides and areas.</p>
            
            <h3>Important Theorems and Properties</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pythagorean Theorem:</strong> a² + b² = c² (for a right-angled triangle with sides a, b and hypotenuse c). Also applies to length calculation in Euclidean/analytic geometry.</li>
                <li><strong>Pythagorean Triples:</strong> Integer triples (a, b, c) satisfying a² + b² = c² (e.g., (3,4,5), (5,12,13), (8,15,17), (12,35,37)).</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Quadrilaterals</h2>
            <p>A type of polygon. Mentioned with specific theorems like Brahmagupta's theorem on diagonals of a cyclic quadrilateral, and specific types related to research on the parallel postulate.</p>

                <li><strong>Area:</strong> The space enclosed by a circle</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Polygons</h2>
            <p>Two-dimensional shapes. Angles are used to study polygons. 'Regular polygons' are mentioned in the context of symmetry.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Axioms and Postulates</h2>
            <p>Euclid's approach introduced axioms or postulates as primary, self-evident properties of geometric objects. This axiomatic method establishes mathematical rigor. The 'parallel postulate' was a key point leading to non-Euclidean geometries.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Measures (Length, Area, Volume)</h2>
            <p>Describe the size or extent of an object in one, two, and three dimensions respectively. In Euclidean and analytic geometry, length of a line segment is calculated by the Pythagorean theorem. Area and volume have explicit formulas and can be defined using integrals in calculus (Riemann integral, Lebesgue integral).</p>
            
            <h3>Related Concepts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Generalization of length/distance (Euclidean, hyperbolic, Lorentz, semi-Riemannian)</li>
                <li><strong>Measure theory:</strong> Extends length, area, volume to assign 'size' to sets</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Congruence and Similarity</h2>
            <p>Concepts describing shared characteristics between two shapes. In Euclidean geometry, congruence means same size and shape, while similarity means same shape. Hilbert treated congruence as an undefined axiomatic term. These are generalized in transformation geometry.</p>
            
            <h3>Types</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Congruence (geometry):</strong> Same size and shape</li>
                <li><strong>Similarity (geometry):</strong> Same shape but possibly different size</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Geometric concepts that define part of the placement of objects in a plane or space.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Dimension</h2>
            <p>Traditional geometry recognized 1D (line/curve), 2D (plane/surface), and 3D (ambient space). The concept has expanded to include higher dimensions (e.g., configuration space), infinite dimension (Hilbert spaces), and positive real numbers (fractal geometry). In algebraic geometry, dimension has several equivalent definitions.</p>

            <h2>Symmetry</h2>
            <p>A fundamental theme in geometry, from ancient symmetric shapes (circle, regular polygons, platonic solids) to modern applications. Felix Klein's Erlangen program defined geometry via its 'symmetry group' (transignment groups). Symmetry in Euclidean geometry is represented by congruences and rigid motions. Duality (e.g., in projective geometry) is another type of symmetry.</p>

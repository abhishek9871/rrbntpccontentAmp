        <h1>Profit and Loss</h1>
        
        <div class="infobox">
            <h2>Basic Definitions</h2>
            <p>Profit and loss calculations are fundamental concepts in mathematics that deal with the financial aspects of buying and selling goods.</p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Terms</h2>
            
            <h3>Cost Price (CP)</h3>
            <p>The amount for which an item is bought. It is the base amount from which profit percentage is calculated. In a transaction, this is the amount an item is purchased for.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If something is bought for $40, then Cost Price (CP) = $40</p>

            <h3>Selling Price (SP)</h3>
            <p>The price at which an item is sold. It is also referred to as 'revenue' or 'sales' and forms the base for profit margin calculation.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If something is sold for $100, then Selling Price (SP) = $100</p>

            <h3>Profit</h3>
            <p>The gain made when selling price is greater than cost price.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If Cost Price = $40 and Selling Price = $100, then Profit = $100 - $40 = $60</p>

            <h3>Loss</h3>
            <p>The amount lost when selling price is less than cost price.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Loss = Cost Price - Selling Price</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Profit Percentage</h2>
            <p>The percentage of cost price that one gets as profit on top of cost price.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Profit Percentage = 100 × (Profit / Cost Price)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If Cost Price = $40 and Selling Price = $100</p>
            <p>Profit = $100 - $40 = $60</p>
            <p>Profit Percentage = (60/40) × 100 = 150%</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Loss Percentage</h2>
            <p>The percentage of cost price that represents the loss.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Loss Percentage = 100 × (Loss / Cost Price)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> If Cost Price = $100 and Selling Price = $80</p>
            <p>Loss = $100 - $80 = $20</p>
            <p>Loss Percentage = (20/100) × 100 = 20%</p>

            <h2>Profit Margin</h2>
            <p>A financial ratio that measures the percentage of profit earned in relation to revenue. It indicates how much profit is made for every dollar of revenue generated.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Profit Margin = 100 × (Profit / Revenue)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Alternative Formula:</strong> Profit Margin = 100 × (Sales - Total Expenses) / Revenue</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Types of Profit Margins</h2>
            
            <h3>Gross Profit Margin</h3>
            <p>Calculated as gross profit divided by net sales (percentage). Gross profit is calculated by deducting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from revenue.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Gross Profit Margin = 100 × (Gross Profit / Net Sales)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Gross Profit Formula:</strong> Gross Profit = Revenue - (Direct materials + Direct labor + Factory overhead)</p>
            
            <p><strong>Net Sales Formula:</strong> Net Sales = Revenue - Cost of Sales Returns - Allowances and Discounts</p>

            <h3>Operating Profit Margin</h3>
            <p>Includes the cost of goods sold and is the earning before interest and taxes (EBIT) known as operating income divided by revenue.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Operating Profit Margin = 100 × (Operating Income / Revenue)</p>

            <h3>Net Profit Margin</h3>
            <p>Net profit divided by revenue. Net profit is calculated as revenue minus all expenses from total sales.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Net Profit Margin = 100 × (Net profit / Revenue)</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Markup</h2>
            <p>Synonymous with 'profit percentage', indicating it is the percentage of cost price that one gets as profit on top of cost price.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Markup = 100 × (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Discount</h2>
            <p>A deduction from the regular price or marked price. Discounts are often mentioned as deductions from revenue when calculating 'Net Sales'.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Discount Amount = Marked Price - Selling Price</p>
            
            <p><strong>Discount Percentage:</strong> Discount Percentage = (Discount Amount / Marked Price) × 100</p>

            <h2>Solved Examples</h2>
            
            <h3>Example 1: Basic Profit Calculation</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A shopkeeper buys a watch for $200 and sells it for $250. Find his profit and profit percentage.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cost Price (CP) = $200</li>
                <li>Selling Price (SP) = $250</li>
                <li>Profit = SP - CP = $250 - $200 = $50</li>
                <li>Profit Percentage = (Profit/CP) × 100 = (50/200) × 100 = 25%</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example 2: Loss Calculation</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A man buys a bicycle for $1500 and sells it for $1200. Find his loss and loss percentage.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cost Price (CP) = $1500</li>
                <li>Selling Price (SP) = $1200</li>
                <li>Loss = CP - SP = $1500 - $1200 = $300</li>
                <li>Loss Percentage = (Loss/CP) × 100 = (300/1500) × 100 = 20%</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example 3: Profit Margin Calculation</h3>
            <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A company has revenue of $500,000 and total expenses of $350,000. Calculate the profit margin.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Revenue = $500,000</li>
                <li>Total Expenses = $350,000</li>
                <li>Profit = Revenue - Expenses = $500,000 - $350,000 = $150,000</li>
                <li>Profit Margin = (Profit/Revenue) × 100 = (150,000/500,000) × 100 = 30%</li>
            </ul>

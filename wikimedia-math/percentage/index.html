        <div class="infobox">
            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>A percentage, percent, or per cent (from Latin 'per centum' meaning 'by a hundred') is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. It is often denoted using the percent sign (%). It is a dimensionless number (pure number), primarily used for expressing proportions, and serves as a unit of measurement.</p>
            <p><strong>General Formula:</strong> Percent value = (Ratio) × 100</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Calculations in fractions of 1/100 existed in Ancient Rome (e.g., Augustus' tax 'centesima rerum venalium'). Standardization of calculations with a denominator of 100 became common from the late 15th to early 16th centuries, with arithmetic texts applying these methods to profit, loss, and interest rates. By the 17th century, interest rates were standardly quoted in hundredths.</p>

            <h2>Percent Sign</h2>
            <p>The term 'percent' derives from Latin 'per centum'. The '%' symbol evolved from the Italian term 'per cento', where 'per' was abbreviated as 'p.' (eventually disappearing) and 'cento' was contracted to two circles separated by a horizontal line.</p>

            <h2>Calculations</h2>
            
            <h3>Basic Calculation</h3>
            <p>To find a value as a percentage of another, compute the ratio and multiply by 100. Example: 50 apples out of 1,250 apples is (50/1250) = 0.04, then 0.04 × 100 = 4%.</p>

            <h3>Percentage of a Percentage</h3>
            <p>Convert both percentages to fractions of 100 or decimals and multiply them. Example: 50% of 40% is (50/100) × (40/100) = 0.50 × 0.40 = 0.20 = 20%.</p>

            <h3>Common Error</h3>
            <p>It is incorrect to divide by 100 and use the percent sign simultaneously, as it implies division by 10,000 (e.g., 25% = 25/100 = 0.25, not 25%/100).</p>

            <h3>Importance of Context</h3>
            <p>When communicating percentages, it's crucial to specify the total (100%) to which it relates. Example: If 60% of students are female, 10% are CS majors, and 5% of female students are CS majors, then 3% of all students are female CS majors (60/100 * 5/100). The percentage of CS majors who are female is (3% / 10%) = 30%.</p>

            <h3>Commutative Property</h3>
            <p>Reversing expressions in multiplication of percentages does not change the result; e.g., 50% of 20 is 10, and 20% of 50 is 10.</p>

            <h2>Variants of Percentage Calculation</h2>
            <p>Different methods exist for solving percentage problems, often depending on prerequisites and requirements, such as using general formulas, ratio equations (proportions), or the 'Rule of 3' (mental arithmetic by finding 1% or 100%).</p>

            <h3>Problem: 42 kg is 7%. How much is 100%?</h3>
            
            <h4>Method 1: General Formula</h4>
            <p>Formula: G = W / p% * 100%</p>
            <p>Calculation: G = 42 kg / 7% * 100% = 600 kg</p>

            <h4>Method 2: Ratio Equation (Proportion)</h4>
            <p>Formula: G / 42 kg = 100% / 7%</p>
            <p>Calculation: G = 42 kg / 7% * 100% = 600 kg</p>

            <h4>Method 3: 'What is 1%' (Rule of 3)</h4>
            <p>Calculation: (42 kg / 7%) = 6 kg (which is 1%); 6 kg * 100 = 600 kg</p>

            <h2>Percentage Increase and Decrease</h2>
            <p>A percentage change (e.g., '10% rise' or '10% fall') is typically relative to the <em>initial value</em> of the quantity.</p>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Increase:</strong> An item priced at $200 rises 10% ($20). New price is $220. The final price is 110% of the initial price. Calculation: $200 * (1 + 0.10) = $220</li>
                <li><strong>100% increase:</strong> An increase of 100% means the final amount is 200% of the initial amount (doubled). Calculation: Final = Initial * (1 + 1.00) = Initial * 2</li>
                <li><strong>800% increase:</strong> An increase of 800% means the final amount is 9 times the original. Calculation: Final = Initial * (1 + 8.00) = Initial * 9</li>
                <li><strong>60% decrease:</strong> A decrease of 60% means the final amount is 40% of the original. Calculation: Final = Initial * (1 - 0.60) = Initial * 0.40</li>
                <li><strong>100% decrease:</strong> A decrease of 100% means the final amount is zero. Calculation: Final = Initial * (1 - 1.00) = 0</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>General Formula:</strong> Final amount = Original amount × (1 + 0.01x), where x is the percent change (positive for increase, negative for decrease).</p>

            <h2>Compounding Percentages</h2>
            
            <h3>Sequential Changes</h3>
            <p>Percent changes applied sequentially do not add up linearly because they are measured relative to different initial values. Example: $200 item, 10% increase to $220, then 10% decrease (of $220) to $198. The net change is not zero.</p>

            <h3>Formula for Sequential Changes</h3>
            <p><strong>Same percentage (x% increase, x% decrease):</strong><br>
            Final amount = p × (1 + 0.01x) × (1 − 0.01x) = p × (1 − (0.01x)²) A net overall decrease by x% of x%.</p>

            <p><strong>Different percentages:</strong><br>
            Final amount = p × (1 + 0.01x) × (1 + 0.01y), where x and y are different percent changes.</p>

            <h3>Percentage Points (pp)</h3>
            <p>Used to clarify absolute changes in percentages. For example, an interest rate rising from 10% to 15% is an increase of 5 percentage points, not a 5% increase (which would be 10% * 1.05 = 10.5%). This avoids major misunderstandings, especially in reporting statistics like election results.</p>

            <h3>Basis Points (bp)</h3>
            <p>Common in financial markets, 100 basis points equal one percentage point (e.g., an increase from 3% to 4% is an increase of 100 basis points).</p>

            <h2>Word and Symbol Usage</h2>
            <p>Style guides vary. In most English forms, 'per cent' (two words) is used, but 'percentage' and 'percentile' are one word. American English commonly uses 'percent' (one word). A dotted abbreviation 'per cent.' was used. Most guides suggest spelling out 'percent' with a numeral (e.g., '1 percent', not '1%') in text, but allow the '%' symbol in scientific texts, tables, and graphics. Decimals are preferred over fractions (e.g., '3.5 percent'). The Chicago Manual of Style typically recommends no space between the numeral and the percent sign (e.g., '10%'), while the International System of Units and ISO 31-0 standard require a space (e.g., '10 %').</p>

            <h2>Other Uses and Applications</h2>
            
            <h3>Sports Statistics</h3>
            <p>Often a misnomer; a 'field goal percentage' of .609 means 60.9%, not 0.609%. 'Winning percentage' of .500 means 50% of matches won.</p>

            <h3>Grade or Slope</h3>
            <p>Used to describe the steepness of a road or railway: 100 × (rise/run), equivalent to the tangent of the angle of inclination times 100.</p>

            <h3>Mixture Composition</h3>
            <p>Used to express composition by mass percent and mole percent.</p>

            <h3>Practical Applications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Baker percentage</li>
                <li>Volume percent</li>
            </ul>

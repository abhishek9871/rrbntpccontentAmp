        <h1>Algebra</h1>
        
        <div class="infobox">
            <h2>Definition</h2>
            <p>Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with abstract systems and the manipulation of expressions. It generalizes arithmetic by introducing variables and algebraic operations beyond standard arithmetic.</p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>Elementary Algebra</h2>
            <p>The main form of algebra taught in schools, focusing on mathematical statements with variables and methods for transforming equations to isolate variables. It uses the same operations as arithmetic but allows variables in addition to numbers.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Variables</h2>
            <p>Symbols representing unspecified or unknown quantities (e.g., x, y, z). They allow for stating relationships and general laws independent of specific numbers. Lowercase letters a, b, c are typically used for constants and coefficients.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Equations</h2>
            <p>Statements comparing two expressions as equal using the equals sign (=), such as 5x²+6x=3y+4. Their truth value depends on variable values. Equations can be classified as:</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Equations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identity Equations:</strong> True for all variable values, e.g., 2x+5x=7x</li>
                <li><strong>Conditional Equations:</strong> True for specific variable values, e.g., x+4=9 is true only if x=5</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The main goal is to find values that make a statement true by transforming and manipulating statements, typically isolating the variable.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Fundamental Algebraic Operations</h2>
            <p>These are the same as arithmetic operations, extended to include variables: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and extraction of roots.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Polynomials</h2>
            <p>An expression with one or more terms added or subtracted (e.g., x⁴+3xy²+5x³−1). Each term is a constant, a variable, or a product of a constant and variables, where each variable can be raised to a positive integer power. Examples include:</p>
            
            <h3>Types of Polynomials</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monomials:</strong> One term</li>
                <li><strong>Binomials:</strong> Two terms</li>
                <li><strong>Trinomials:</strong> Three terms</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The degree is the maximal sum of variable exponents in any term.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Linear Equations</h2>
            <p>Polynomials of degree one. An equation is linear if it can be written as a₁x₁+a₂x₂+...+aₙxₙ=b, where a₁, ..., aₙ and b are constants (e.g., x₁−7x₂+3x₃=0, ¼x−y=4). Geometrically, linear equations with two variables represent lines.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Quadratic Equations</h2>
            <p>Second-degree polynomial equations, typically of the form ax²+bx+c=0. Solutions are found using the quadratic formula:</p>
            
            <div class="formula">
                <p>x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / (2a)</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Factoring</h2>
            <p>A method to simplify polynomials by rewriting them as a product of several factors, useful for analyzing them and finding values where they equal zero. For example, x²−3x−10 can be factorized as (x+2)(x−5), indicating the polynomial is zero if x is −2 or 5.</p>
